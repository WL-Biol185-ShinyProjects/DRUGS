"SUMMARY:

This is a quantitative, non-inferiority study using healthy participants to compare tidal volumes at rest measured by both a standard RIP belt and a flow-regulated nasal oxygen delivery system FRNDS cannula.

Recording of tidal breathing is essential for patients undergoing evaluation for respiratory disease and reduced exercise capacity. Conventional spirometry techniques involving pneumotachometers are currently employed worldwide in pulmonary testing laboratories to record pulmonary flow and calculate tidal volumes by allowing subjects to breath out of mouth into these devices. However, concurrent use of pneumotachometers while testing a novel nasal device is not feasible. Respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) has been developed and validated to evaluate tidal ventilation during quiet breathing using a band around the chest. RIP signals may be contaminated by body movements resulting in artifacts which may be a limitation. However, although a crude method when compared to spirometry, RIP remains a viable method for comparison.

FRNDS is a novel cannula device that can both measure tidal volume (VT) in real time while simultaneously delivering air to the patient. The gold-standard of measuring VT clinically is spirometry; however, this test cannot be completed when patients are receiving supplemental oxygen or air.

Thus far, the FRNDS cannula has been tested in vitro with a cylindrical flow model and has accurately measured simulated VTs with 80% accuracy, but has not yet been validated in Human subjects. To assess the devices robustness in a clinical scenario is essential to the development and eventually adaptation of FRNDS in clinical care.

OBJECTIVES:-

In this study the investigators aim to describe and validate flow-regulated nasal oxygen delivery system (FRNDS) instrumented nasal cannula as a non-inferior methodology of measuring flows at the nasal interface compared to conventional methods (e.g., RIP belts) with the added benefit of administering a dose of air to the subjects.

While the FRNDS device was validated in vitro in a cylindrical model, the investigators aim to show equivalence to standard respiratory measurement methods in healthy subjects. This milestone will be essential towards the eventual translation of an adaptive cannula system that measures and adjusts air flow according to patient needs in real time.

ENDPOINTS:

The primary endpoint of this study is the continuous measurement of a test subjects Vt and Minute ventilation ( VE) while simultaneously delivering variable volumes of air to the patient and comparing these results with Vts and VE captured with conventional technology (RIP belts). The investigators will also be collecting inspiratory time (Ti) expiratory time (Te) continuously and a single measurement of nasal cavity openings (e.g., internal vertical and horizontal dimensions 1 cm inside the nares using calipers)",Respiratory Failure with Hypoxia,ALL,NA,"Carilion Clinic Center for Simulation, Research and Patient Safety, Roanoke, Virginia, 24012, United States|Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, Roanoke, Virginia, 24016, United States"

"Screening is an important tool for early colorectal cancer detection, and the most recent evidence suggests that early detection significantly improves survival rates. Current medical guidelines recommend that all people aged 45 to 75 be screened regularly. However, actual rates of screening in the United States are much lower than this.

Colonoscopy is the gold standard in colon cancer screening, serving as both screening and prevention. However there are many barriers to colonoscopy uptake, including lack of awareness, patient reticence, scheduling complexity, and market variation in access. Stool testing is a valuable alternative to colonoscopy for low-risk patients. Exact Sciences is the company that makes Cologuard, which is the current best-in-class stool testing for colon cancer screening.

Despite being a convenient at-home screening option, patient engagement with screening via stool testing has room for improvement. Over 40% of Ascension patients who have a stool testing order placed for them never return the screening kit in the mail.

A large body of research demonstrates that interventions informed by behavioral science can support patients in engaging in a variety of preventative health behaviors.

"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the abilities of Cystatin C (CysC) and CysC-based estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) equations to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of meropenem and cefepime relative to Serum Creatinine (SCR), Serum Creatinine based Equation (SCRE)and iohexol at the population and individual levels in critically ill adult patients with suspected or documented AMR Gram-negative infections. We hypothesize that CysC and CysC-based eGFR equations will characterize the PK profiles of meropenem and cefepime at the population and individual levels with greater accuracy and precision than SCR and SCREs.

"TITLE: Phase 1 First in Human Trial to Assess Safety and Tolerability of the Novel ACK1 Inhibitor (R)-9bMS in Patients with Prostate Cancer (PHAROS)

STUDY DESCRIPTION: Prostate cancer (PC) patients receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but recalcitrant disease recurs typically within 2-3 years, referred to as the Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapies, such as Enzalutamide (Enz) or Abiraterone (Abi), are FDA-approved therapeutics for CRPC patients. However, virtually all patients develop resistance.

A non-receptor tyrosine kinase, ACK1 act as a novel epigenetic modifier in prostate tumors, regulating AR and its splice variant, AR-V7 expression. A new class of ACK1 small molecule inhibitor, (R)-9bMS, was developed that exhibited excellent drug-like properties. Treatment with (R)-9bMS suppressed Abi and Enz-resistant tumor growth in mice. Robust immune activation against prostate tumors was also reflected in mice treated with ACK1 inhibitor, (R)-9bMS. Importantly (R)-9bMS functionally reinvigorated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CRPC patients to mount a robust immune response against CRPC organoids. Collectively, these data indicate that the ACK1 inhibitor, (R)-9bMS, fulfills a unique niche, wherein it not only suppressed AR/AR-V7 within the tumor milieu, but also activated host immune system by overcoming CSK-restrained LCK activity, to mount a robust 'dual' anti-tumor response.

OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of (R)-9bMS in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Secondary Objectives: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of (R)-9bMS in patients with CRPC. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of (R)-9bMS in patients after single and multiple dose oral administration. To assess clinical outcomes and anti-tumor activity in patients treated with (R)-9bMS.

ENDPOINTS: Primary Endpoint: Frequency of dose-limiting toxicities and toxicity and severe AEs per CTCAE v 5.0.

Secondary Endpoints:

* RP2D (recommended phase 2 dose)
* PK (pharmacokinetics)
* PSA responses
* Duration of responses
* ORR (objective response rate)
* OS (overall survival)
* PFS (progression free survival)
* DSS (disease specific survival)
* Toxicity and severe AEs per CTCAE v 5.0 STUDY POPULATION: Approximately 18-30 adult patients with a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer will be enrolled.

This process requires numerous visits and can be disruptive to the lives of patients and caregivers. Bringing cancer care to the patients with in-home intravesical therapy may help reduce the disruption to daily lives. In-home intravesical chemotherapy may be safe and tolerable and may also be preferable to in-clinic administration in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.",Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Carcinoma|Stage 0 Gallbladder Cancer AJCC V8|Stage I Bladder Cancer AJCC V8,ALL,PHASE1|PHASE2,"Mayo Clinic in Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224-9980, United States"

"The proposed research seeks to determine whether virtual coaching and social support focusing on key social cognitive factors will be an effective strategy for maintaining physical activity (PA) after completing cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Despite the well-documented benefits of CR, only 15-50% of individuals continue to exercise 6 months after completing CR.4-6 Thus, after 36 sessions (typically 12 weeks), many patients are left without the support necessary to sustain physical activity (PA) and prevent adverse secondary cardiac events. Though previous research has explored interventions to sustain PA after CR, many studies have been lacking in a theoretical basis, objective measurement of PA, measurement, and analysis of psychosocial and social cognitive factors, and long-term impact on clinical outcomes. Low-cost, pragmatic approaches to maintaining PA after CR is urgently needed for older adults, and virtual technologies offer promising solutions to promote adherence to PA. The three specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine the effect of virtual coaching and social support on adherence to PA (measured by objective step counts) in the intervention vs. control groups; secondary measures will be amount of sedentary time, functional fitness, and self-reported exercise; 2) determine the effect of virtual coaching and social support on psychosocial and social cognitive factors in the intervention vs. control groups; 2a) evaluate the extent to which psychosocial and social cognitive factors mediate the effect of the intervention on PA adherence; 3) examine differences in CVD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, HbA1c, BMI) between groups.",Cardiac Rehabilitation,ALL,NA,"University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States"

"Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) between the ages of 15-24 years continue to bear the brunt of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections in South Africa despite progress recorded in prevention and treatment programmes. The ongoing susceptibility of young women to HIV infection and the sub-optimal uptake of prevention options such as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) that are highly effective creates a need for an HIV vaccine to benefit populations at substantial risk of HIV infection. However, lessons from previous vaccine studies and the recent COVID-19 vaccine have highlighted significant barriers to vaccine uptake, such as widespread misinformation and vaccine hesitancy. These challenges threaten the successful implementation of a future HIV vaccine. Building on these insights, this study will utilise psychological inoculation theory to develop and evaluate HIV vaccine messages among adolescent girls and young women.

The first group will receive treatment based on what they normally would receive, including medications, education, and exercise (Usual Care Group). The second group will receive contemporary non-vaginal treatment including manual therapy, dry needling, and specific breathing training (Emerging Field-expedient Care Group). The third group will receive intravaginal treatment by a pelvic health specialist (Gold-standard Intravaginal Specialist Care Group). Participants will be asked about their pain and symptoms and have measurements taken of their pelvic and back muscles after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. In addition to seeing which treatments work best, clinical decision tools (using medical and trauma history along with clinical examination) will be developed to identify women with CPP likely to respond favorably to non-vaginal conservative interventions. This study will help determine the best non-vaginal treatment strategies for women with CPP and help clinicians quickly determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment by non-pelvic health physical therapists (e.g., in theater), vs. patients who should be referred for pelvic health specialty care.",Chronic Pelvic Pain,FEMALE,NA,"U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence (MEDCoE), San Antonio, Texas, 78234, United States|Baylor University, Waco, Texas, 76701, United States"
"This clinical trial develops a chatbot smartphone application (app), QuitBot, and text messaging to help American Indians (AI) and Alaska Natives (AN) to quit smoking commercial tobacco (smoking cessation), and evaluates two remote smoking cessation programs to see how well they work for helping AI/AN people quit smoking commercial tobacco. AI/AN populations have one of the highest rates of commercial cigarette smoking of any racial and ethnic group in the United States (US). They also have a higher rate of developing smoking-related cancer but are less likely to quit smoking. The two programs are designed to provide personalized support in setting a smoking cessation goal, tasks to reach the smoking cessation goal, and motivation to remain smoke-free. This may help to keep participants engaged and support them in their quit efforts, and may improve smoking cessation among AI and AN.",Cigarette Smoking-Related Carcinoma,ALL,NA,"Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium, Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States"

"The two primary objectives of this study are to test whether intermittent theta-burst (iTBS) can affect behavioral change as compared to treatment as usual (TAU, sham) in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in inpatient substance use treatment. The secondary objective is to determine whether iTBS reduces the risk for relapse at four months compared to sham. It is hypothesized that individuals who receive iTBS treatment will show attenuated prefrontal cortex (PFC) CNS responses to alcohol related cues and reductions in risk-taking behavior and impulsivity as measured by PFC responses measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs). The proposed approach will be to measure the effect of iTBS treatment on PFC CNS response. Participants will be randomized to receive 5 days (4 x sessions/day x 600 pulses/session = 12,000 pulses) of iTBS or sham to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) while being exposed to alcohol cues five minutes prior to treatment and during treatment. The investigators will target the Beam/F3 scalp location and use the TMS Navigator Research Premium stereotaxic system for neuronavigation. PFC response data will be gathered using fNIRs measuring cue reactivity, risk-taking (Balloon Analog Risk Test), and impulsiveness (Go No Go task). The primary outcomes will be the mean changes in pre-post PFC response data gathered using the fNIRs sessions. The rationale for this approach is that TBS can be delivered over a shorter time frame than rTMS and may require fewer sessions, allowing for a better fit within a 28-day inpatient treatment stay.",Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD),ALL,NA,"Caron Treatment Centers, Wernersville, Pennsylvania, 19565, United States"

"The goal of this experimental study is to understand if endotracheal tube (ETT) suctioning increases pain and causes stress on the body in intubated adult ICU patients. These patients are already on ventilators, which means they need suctioning to keep their airways clear, but this procedure may be uncomfortable and cause stress.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

Does ETT suctioning raise pain levels as measured by the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT)? Does ETT suctioning increase certain chemicals in the blood (hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid) that show stress and lack of oxygen in the body? Researchers will compare patients who have ETT suctioning (intervention group) with those who do not have suctioning during the study period (control group) to see if there are differences in pain and blood markers of stress.

Participants will:

Have pain measured before and after suctioning using the CPOT. Have blood samples taken from an existing line at three time points: 5 minutes before, 5 minutes after, and 30 minutes after suctioning.

Provide demographic information (like age, gender, and diagnosis) from medical records.

This research will help improve how pain is managed for ICU patients who cannot speak for themselves, potentially leading to better pain relief methods in the future.","Intensive Care Unit ICU|Intubation|Critical Illness|Mechanical Ventilation|Pain Measurement|Pain, Procedural|Oxidative Stress|Hypoxia|Biomarkers / Blood|Adult|Uric Acid|Sepsis|COVID|Influenza|Pneumonia",ALL,NA,"Loma Linda University Medical Center Troesh Medical Campus, Loma Linda, California, 92354, United States"

"What is the ultimate applicability of the research? Individuals with SCI face several challenges when trying to engage in exercise following injury. Barriers to engagement include cost, transportation, and lack of SCI accessible resources. At the same time, individuals with SCI are at risk of developing negative health consequences (e.g., cardiovascular disease) associated with physical inactivity. A critical need exists to improve relevant, accessible, and sustainable home-based exercise interventions for individuals with SCI to lower the risk of developing secondary comorbid diseases from physical inactivity and to promote wellness. This research will investigate a fun and novel in-home virtual reality system aimed toward improving physical fitness of individuals SCI with the ultimate goal of improving physical, emotional, and psychosocial quality of life. Virtual reality gaming has been used for a long time to improve physical fitness, but there have yet to be virtual reality games designed specifically for individuals with SCI. The explicit aim of this research is therefore to develop a therapeutic technology that will be widely accessible to individuals with SCI.

What persons with SCI and/or their caregivers will it help, and how will it help them? We aim to provide a readily available exercise platform for individuals with SCI, across a spectrum of physical function. Research has shown that individuals with SCI are particularly prone to be physically inactive. The consequences of physical inactivity have been well documented and include negative outcomes in physical, psychological, and social health with reduced quality of life. For the current study, we will refine our existing virtual reality exercise platform, VR-Move with a focus on non ambulatory individuals with bilaterally preserved C6 function. Our focus on using the exercise platform for this cohort of the SCI population is meant to provide a basis for developing and catering to the platform for higher levels of SCI injury (higher quadriplegic). From our previous work with virtual reality interventions in SCI, we recognize that this product can be widely used by individuals across the age spectrum independently of their home environment.

What are the potential clinical applications, benefits, and risks? The proposed virtual reality exercise platform, VR-Move, is intended to provide one of the few accessible exercise modalities designed specifically for individuals with SCI and is readily adaptable across the clinical spectrum - including clinic and self-guided home use. There are no known risks associated with this research.

How will the pilot clinical trial advance the research findings along the translational spectrum? This project aims to refine and assess timely therapeutic technology with the specific intention of translating study findings into a clinically validated, widely accessible health product that can be deployed and implemented within the home. The project likewise demonstrates collaboration between academia, industry (a veteran-owned business), and veteran SCI communities. Project completion will offer initial validation of a novel health promoting modality (i.e., virtual reality exercise) informed by individuals living with SCI and experts in SCI to be relevant and responsive to specific health/exercise needs of persons living with SCI. Larger clinical trial testing will subsequently inform product commercialization and dissemination. The resulting platform, developed for unattended in-home use, is expected to make a meaningful contribution to SCI health and physical fitness, accessibility, and quality of life.

What is the projected time it may take to achieve a person-related outcome? The team is purposefully refining the existing exercise platform, VR-Move, so that it can be easily implemented within people's homes or in clinic settings. Pending findings from the pilot clinical study, this exercise platform would be available immediately to individuals with SCI

What are the likely contributions of the proposed research project to advancing the field of SCI research, patient care, and/or quality of life? The proposed study may make significant contributions across several areas. First, it will facilitate fruitful clinical data and basic lines of scientific inquiry regarding the application of the physical activity paradigm. The study will also increase our knowledge regarding the importance of consumer advocate-driven research for individuals with SCI. Second, low-activity following SCI is consistently associated with reduced quality of life among individuals with SCI and their families; access to an inexpensive portable intervention will therefore significantly improve quality of life among those affected by low-activity SCI.",Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI),ALL,NA,"Drexel University Health Science Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States"

"Background:

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer affects the organs (such as the stomach, large and small intestine, pancreas, colon, liver, and biliary system) of the digestive tract. In some participants who have had surgery for GI cancer, blood tests show that the cancer has spread despite being unable to be identified by scans. Certain gene mutations (changes) in GI cancer (such as KRAS or TP53) can be targeted by T cells, a type of immune cell, in individuals with specific HLA types (genes that help proteins in the body know what is self and non-self). Researchers want to see if they can stop GI cancer from returning or spreading in people with these gene mutations and specific HLA types.

Objective:

To test therapy with modified T-cells to prevent or delay the return of GI cancer after standard treatment. T-cells play a role in the body s immune system.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 to 72 years with GI cancer that was treated with standard therapy and is not seen on imaging scans. They must have specific gene mutations and HLA types. They also must have certain clinical or blood tests showing the cancer is spreading (elevating CA19-9 or detectable ctDNA).

Design:

Participants will be divided into 2 groups. Participants nor the study team can choose what Group to participate in; this is done by randomization , like flipping a coin. Participants will have a 1-to-1 chance of being in Group 1 or Group 2.

Group 1 will receive T-cell therapy. Their own T-cells will be collected. In a lab, the cells will be combined with a virus that carries a protein to target cancer cells.

Group 1 participants will stay in the hospital for 3 weeks or more. They will have chemotherapy, and their modified T-cells will be infused through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein.

Group 1 participants will visit the clinic every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 5 years. Then they will have follow-up visits for another 10 years under a different protocol.

Group 2 participants will not receive treatment with T-cells.

"A serious consequence of systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is secondary central nervous system (CNS) relapse, which occurs in approximately 5% of all patients. Many CNS relapses occur within the first year after completion of frontline treatment and are associated with significantly increased mortality; thus, it is important to tailor frontline treatment to provide prophylaxis against CNS relapse in those patients who are determined to be high-risk.

Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is standard of care for patients with DLBCL who relapse one year or more after first remission, and it has been shown to improve progression-free survival for patients with primary CNS lymphoma.

The four-drug BEAM regimen (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) is the preferred conditioning regimen for DLBCL patients undergoing ASCT; however, patients with primary CNS lymphoma receive thiotepa plus carmustine as their conditioning regimen due to its better CNS penetration.

The investigators hypothesize that food DNA primarily transits through the digestive system within 24 hours, with maximal detection in stool samples collected the day after ingestion. Previous research has focused on food DNA digestion in human gastric juices, leaving digestion through the entire gut largely unexplored. This study employs a fixed-order within subjects design involving healthy participants. Each participant will submit a baseline stool sample, consume a single dose of a study-specific powdered food (reconstituted in water) differing from their usual diet, and provide the subsequent five stool samples. If five samples are collected in fewer than five days, an additional sample will be obtained on the fifth day post-consumption. The presence and decline of food specific DNA in these samples will be quantified using qPCR, enabling us to determine the digestion rate of food DNA. The study design poses with minimal risk as it non-invasively monitors the natural process of food DNA digestion and transit through stool sample analysis.",Digestion Rate,ALL,NA,"Medical Sciences Research Building III (MSRB III), Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States"

"Lower extremity revascularization combined with supervised exercise significantly improves walking performance compared to revascularization alone in people who have PAD without limb threatening ischemia. However, supervised exercise is inaccessible or burdensome for most PAD patients. We hypothesize that home-based exercise combined with lower extremity revascularization will significantly improve walking performance compared to revascularization alone in patients with PAD undergoing revascularization for disabling PAD.

We further hypothesize that inorganic nitrate, a major source of nitric oxide (NO) abundant in beetroot juice, will improve walking performance after lower extremity revascularization, compared to placebo. In preclinical models, NO inhibits inflammation, neointimal hyperplasia, thrombosis, and vascular smooth muscle cell migration at sites of revascularization. NO increases angiogenesis and perfusion, repairs skeletal muscle damaged by ischemia, and stimulates mitochondrial activity.

In a randomized clinical trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design, we will test the following two primary hypotheses in 386 patients randomized within three months of a successful lower extremity revascularization for disabling PAD: First, that home-based exercise combined with lower extremity revascularization will improve six-minute walk distance more than revascularization alone at 6-month follow-up (Primary Aim #1). Second, that nitrate-rich beetroot juice combined with lower extremity revascularization will improve six-minute walk, compared to placebo combined with revascularization at 6-month follow-up (Primary Aim #2).",Peripheral Artery Disease|Intermittent Claudication|Peripheral Vascular Disease|Mobility Limitation|Revascularization,ALL,PHASE3,"University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, 85724, United States|Rancho Research Institute, Downey, California, 90242, United States|Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, 30307, United States|Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, 03766, United States|University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States"

This is different from how doxycycline is typically used for syphilis because the full doxycycline dose will be taken at the same time of day, rather than split up into a twice daily regimen. Lab data support that taking the medication as a single daily dose should be effective as treatment, but it has not been studied clinically. The main question this study aims to answer is:

Is doxycycline taken as a single daily dose of 200mg for 14 days an effective treatment for early syphilis based on a combined outcome of clinical improvement and blood test improvement?

Participants will:

1. Take doxycycline 200mg daily for 14 days
2. Submit oral and rectal swabs that test for syphilis bacteria every other day for 2 weeks, returned by mail
3. Complete 2 brief online surveys over the first 2 weeks
4. Return to the clinic for an interview and blood draw every 3 months for a maximum of 3 study visits, including the first visit

The investigators will compare the percentage of participants in the study who have response to treatment by 6 months to that of persons who have received standard (CDC-recommended) regimens.

"High blood pressure has a different rate effect on many minoritized individuals. African Americans, as a result of high blood pressure, are six times more likely to go through kidney failure compared to white counterparts. Hispanic communities are also disproportionately affected by high blood pressure and, unfortunately, generally have lower knowledge about the effects on the kidneys as well. Unfortunately, many minorized and underserved communities are affected by the weight of the social determinants of health, i.e., housing, education, food, health care, etc., that contribute to large disparities in health outcomes. These factors lead to poor care management, less ability to manage care effectively, and disengagement from care. Health education is vital to recognizing and communicating with minoritized patients with hypertension-induced chronic renal disease. As the patient's knowledge of the condition grows, this can significantly influence the trust between clinicians and patients. Effective and patient-centered education can inspire patients to be proactive in their prevention strategies with clinicians.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced form of 3-dimensional radiation therapy that uses computer-generated images to show the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy reduces the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor. Radiation therapy sometimes causes unwanted symptoms or side effects, including late effects such as hearing loss and dental problems. The severity of the side effects is related to the radiation dose received and the amount of tissue that received radiation. De-escalation IMRT uses lower doses of radiation based on a good response to induction chemotherapy. Giving de-escalated IMRT may be as effective as standard doses of IMRT in treating patients with EBV-associated nasopharyngeal cancer.",Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Stage III Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma AJCC v8|Stage IVA Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma AJCC v8|Nasopharyngeal Cancer|Nasopharyngeal Cancer Stage,ALL,NA,"University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States"

The quality of conventional CBCT is good enough to align patients for their daily radiation therapy but CBCT images have poor contrast and are susceptible to imaging artefacts that limit their usability for other tasks in the radiation therapy workflow.

Varian Medical Systems, the sponsor of this study, has developed new CBCT imaging technology called HyperSight that so far has demonstrated increased image quality compared with conventional CBCT images. This new HyperSight CBCT imager has previously been built into Varian Halcyon and Ethos treatment machines, where the imager is enclosed in a ring that rotates around the patient. Now, HyperSight has been built into a Varian treatment machine, called TrueBeam, where the imager is mounted on a C-shaped arm that rotates around you to acquire an image.

This study is being done to evaluate the image quality of HyperSight CBCT compared to conventional CBCT images, and to determine whether HyperSight CBCT can improve the process of delivering radiation treatments.

The goal of this study is to collect images from this new HyperSight-TrueBeam CBCT imager from a variety of patients and locations in the body.

"This pilot health services interventional study aims to prospectively assess the effectiveness of a pre-treatment rehabilitation (prehabilitation) program across a diverse cohort of adult cancer patients via a randomized pilot trial. Upon screening and identification of high-risk features through a central navigation process, patients referred to oncology clinics will be approached to participate in tailored prehabilitation interventions.

"Premature ovarian failure, also known as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), or premature menopause, affects 1-2% of women under 40. The diagnosis is typically made based on high levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and absent or irregular menstrual periods. It leads to infertility and menopause-like effects (hot flashes and thin bones) due to low estrogen levels. POI can result from various factors such as genetic conditions, autoimmune diseases, or previous medical treatments like chemotherapy.

Treatment of POI usually involves hormone replacement therapy and, if pregnancy is desired, assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) using an egg donor. However, IVF may not be an option for everyone due to personal, religious, ethical or financial reasons. Recent advances in medicine have identified ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) as a potential solution. OTT involves transplanting either fresh or frozen ovarian tissue into the pelvic area, where it can begin functioning again. Studies in animals and humans have shown success in restoring hormonal function and even achieving pregnancies in some cases. Initial human trials of ovarian tissue transplants from another individual began with identical twins and have since expanded to include non-identical siblings with compatible tissue matches using immunosuppression. Success rates of OTT have been promising, with multiple live births reported between identical twins. Long-term studies indicate that transplanted tissue can remain functional for up to eight years. Ovarian tissue transplantation offers a promising avenue for women with POI to help restore fertility and hormonal function. Continued research and refinement of tissue techniques are essential to improve outcomes and expand access to this innovative treatment option.

This study will enroll 10 participants who will undergo ovarian tissue transplantation donated by a non-identical sister using an immunosuppression protocol at University Hospitals.","Ovarian Failure|Ovarian Insufficiency|Menopause Ovarian Failure|Menopause, Premature|Infertility, Female|Endocrine Female Infertility",FEMALE,NA,"University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106, United States"

"This clinical trial assesses the change in lymphatic structure from placement of an intravenous (IV) line and fluid administration using a diagnostic agent, indocyanine green (ICG), with SPY (Trademark) angiography in breast cancer patients at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Patients that are diagnosed with breast cancer with lymph node involvement often undergo treatment that includes surgery to remove the axillary nodes and radiation. Unfortunately, this procedure increases the incidence of BCRL in the surgical arm, as well as other problems including heaviness of the arm, fibrotic skin changes, and an increase in infection risk. Because of these symptoms, venipuncture (blood draw) is often avoided in these arms. Researchers want to show that placement of an IV line and fluid administration in patients at risk for BCRL will indeed not alter the lymphatic structure of the arm and will not change the incidence of BCRL by administering indocyanine green (ICG) dye to patients and assessing their arm lymphatics. ICG is a fluorescent dye that is able to be visualized by the SPY angiography imaging system as it travels through the lymphatic system, allowing researchers to assess how well blood flows throughout the body.

"This phase I trial tests the safety, tolerability and impact of adding propranolol to standard radiation therapy (RT) before surgery for the treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Sarcomas are a diverse group of rare tumors arising from connective tissue. Approximately 13,000-16,000 new cases of sarcomas arise in the United States annually. Sarcoma management involves multidisciplinary team decision making and treatment is multimodal utilizing chemotherapy (if needed) and RT prior to surgical intervention. Propranolol is a drug that has been used for many years for high blood pressure by blocking both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Preclinical data suggests that blocking the beta-2 adrenergic receptors can improve the response to both chemotherapy and radiation. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. RT before surgery makes the tumor smaller and reduces the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. Surgery is the most common treatment for soft tissue sarcoma. Giving propranolol with standard RT before surgery may be safe, tolerable and impactful in treating patients with soft tissue carcinoma.",Soft Tissue Sarcoma,ALL,PHASE1,"Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, 14263, United States"

"Many patients in the emergency department have veins that are difficult to get an intrevenous (IV) catheter into (called ""difficult IV access""). These patients may require other methods to obtain access to a vein for administration of the necessary medications. The 2-inch long IV is most commonly used in emergency departments for people with difficulty IV access. Typically, a healthcare worker will use an ultrasound to help to see the veins underneath the skin while inserting the IV into the vein. That is, the ultrasound helps the healthcare worker visualize veins that are deeper in the arm and may not be felt through the skin. Another device that can be used is a 4-inch midline catheter. This device is less commonly used as many emergency departments do not have participants available, but it serves the same purpose as the 2-inch long IVs (that is, to give medicine into the vein and sometimes to take blood). A 4-inch midline catheter is similar to a 2-inch long IV, but has a few differences. First, the 4-inch midline catheter is even longer than the 2-inch long IV. The 4-inch midline catheter is 10-cm (about 4-inches or the size of 4 quarters side-by-side), while the 2-inch long IV is 4.78-cm (nearly 2-inches or two quarters side-by-side). Second, the 4-inch midline catheter is inserted into using a guidewire to help move the catheter in the vein (similar in concept to a train moving along a track), while the 2-inch long IV does not have this guidewire. The guidewire does not hurt and most do not know it is being used. It is just an additional step to help guide the catheter in the vein.

This phase II trial studies how well the addition of 18F-DOPA (amino acid) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to standard of care (SOC) imaging can improve the clinical management of patients with brain tumors in over 50% of cases. PET is an imaging test that helps to measure the information about functions of tissues and organs within the body. A PET scan uses a radioactive drug (radiotracer) to show this activity. CT scan uses X-rays to create images of the bones and internal organs within the body. Combining a PET scan with a CT scan can help make the images easier to interpret. PET/CT scans are hybrid scanners that combine both of the two modalities into a single scan. This allows images of both anatomy (CT) and function (PET) to be taken during the same scan. The 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan is done with a very small amount of a radioactive tracer called FDOPA. The PET/CT scan is then used to detect the location of tumors.

"The primary goal of this study is to establish the safety of chronic Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) of the chemotherapeutic drug Topotecan for patients with recurrent malignant glioma that harbors the Isocitrate Dehydrogenase mutation (IDH-mut). The secondary goal of the study is to study drug distribution and assess the tumor response to prolonged continuous CED of Topotecan.

Convection Enhanced Delivery is a novel method of drug delivery that allows administration of a drug directly to the brain. In CED, a drug pump is placed under the skin in the chest or abdominal region. The pump is connected to a catheter that is tunneled underneath the skin to the brain. The tip of the catheter then infuses Topotecan directly onto the brain tumor. There will be a total of four treatment infusions over the course of 23-29 days, with a 5-7-day rest period between each infusion. Throughout this period, patients' health will be monitored through imaging, blood draws, and regular exams.

"This clinical trial develops and tests how well a multi-level intervention (MLI), The Ohio State University (OSU) SCREEN Community Program, works to increase screening and follow-up for breast, cervical and colorectal (CRC) cancer among low-income and un/underinsured female residents in three counties in Central Ohio. In Ohio, incidence and mortality rates for breast, cervical and CRC are higher than or similar to the national average; in addition, underserved populations - minority, rural and low-income women - have higher rates of these cancers. Screening can detect precancerous colorectal and cervical lesions and other early-stage cancers when treatment is less intensive and more successful and is known to reduce mortality rates for breast, cervical, and CRC, however many of these women lack access to health care and screenings. This MLI includes clinic-based components, such as patient education, as well as community-based strategies, such as media programs and training health workers, that can increase rates of guideline-recommended breast, cervical and CRC screening and follow-ups in underserved populations.

"Background:

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a disease that causes scarring in parts of the kidneys that filter waste. This can lead to protein loss in the urine, which can worsen kidney function. The kidneys may fail over time, and dialysis or a kidney transplant may be needed. Other treatments for this disease do not always work and often have adverse effects. Better treatments for FSGS are needed.

Objective:

To test a study drug (ManNAc) in people with FSGS.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with FSGS.

Design:

Participants will have 6 to 7 clinic visits over 14 weeks. Two of the visits will require overnight stays for 2 or 3 nights.

ManNAc is a white powder that comes in a sachet. It is dissolved in water and taken twice a day by mouth. Participants will take their first dose at the clinic. They will learn how to store ManNAc and prepare each dose. They will record their doses in a diary. They will also write down any adverse effects or troubles they have using the drug at home.

During clinic visits, participants will have physical exams with blood and urine tests. They will complete questionnaires about their health, sleep habits, and fatigue symptoms.

During overnight visits, participants will also have 24-hour urine collection.

A study team member will call participants 1 week after the first dose to check on their health. Follow-up phone calls will then be every 2 weeks after each clinic visit.

Participants may meet with a dietitian to discuss nutrition while taking the ManNAc.

Participants may choose to have genetic tests.",Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis,ALL,PHASE2,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

"Patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) sometimes must undergo vitrectomy surgery (PPV) for diabetic and non-diabetic related issues. Patients may have improved DME with anti-VEGF therapy and ranibizumab has been found to reduce central macular thickness (CMT) with anti-VEGF therapy following vitrectomy. Those patients still require intravitreal injections but the pharmacokinetics of a vitrectomized eye are different than those eyes that have not undergone vitrectomy. The clearance of protein molecules is quicker in vitrectomized eyes so these patients may be more refractory to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. In rabbit models, the half-life of both bevacizumab and ranibizumab were reduced by a factor 1.8 and 1.3, respectively, after pars plana vitrectomy. In a study examining intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in human eyes, the half-life was found to be 18.6 days in non-vitrectomized eyes and 3.2 days in vitrectomized eyes, but there was considerable intrasubject variation. Patients with various disease states, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have been managed with monthly anti-VEGF therapy successfully after vitrectomy surgery. Another study performed by the DRCR net showed that patients with DME treated with anti-VEGF are not affected in the long term if they had had a previous vitrectomy.

"HIV prevalence among transgender women (TW) in the United States is high (\~14%). The best way to reduce HIV incidence in this population is to link TW to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce HIV transmission by up to 86%, with optimal adherence. The FDA approved the first long-acting form of PrEP, injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA), in late 2021, which has the potential to decrease HIV transmission and increase PrEP adherence among TW. The addition of CAB-LA to available PrEP options necessitates TW and PrEP service providers select the best method (oral vs injectable) for each TW. However, TW have unique concerns about PrEP (e.g., interactions with gender-affirming hormones) and report that patient/provider discussions on this medication are suboptimal. Thus, to inform this shared decision process, the proposed study builds on formative work by developing and pilot-testing ""WePrEP,"" a PrEP-focused bilingual digital shared decision-making tool (SDMT), tailored to diverse English- and Spanish-speaking TW and PrEP service providers. WePrEP will support communication between TW and PrEP service providers as they identify the ideal PrEP product for each TW and discuss associated adherence strategies by cuing conversations on TW's unique PrEP needs/concerns and presenting pertinent information that is culturally relevant and tailored to this population. To develop and test WePrEP, the investigators will partner with the Mile High Behavioral Healthcare Transgender Center of the Rockies, a Denver-based transgender-serving organization. They will use McNulty et al.'s adapted Shared Decision-Making Model for TW to guide the iterative participatory design process we will use with a group of racially/ethnically diverse TW and PrEP service providers, to develop WePrEP; we will begin this process using prototypes created from preliminary data (Aim 1a). The investigators will rigorously assess the usability of WePrEP via simulated patient/provider discussions (Aim 1b). Next, they will pilot test WePrEP in a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=69 TW) with 2:1 randomization. In the RCT, PrEP service providers (N=4, of which n=1 is bilingual) will use WePrEP with intervention TW to select CAB-LA or oral PrEP and discuss adherence. Other providers (N=2, of which n=1 is bilingual) will give control TW a standard of care explanation of PrEP (CDC recommendations) to help them make their PrEP choice. TW will be referred to Sheridan Health Services to start PrEP. We will assess primary (feasibility; acceptability) and secondary (potential mechanisms of action of WePrEP; preliminary impact) outcome measures using validated scales and rigorous qualitative methods (Aims 2, 3). By creating a bilingual digital SDMT to enhance communication between TW and PrEP service providers as TW choose their ideal PrEP modality, this project is likely to make a widespread and lasting impact on TW's uptake and adherence to PrEP.",HIV Prevention,MALE,NA,"Transgender Center of the Rockies, Sheridan, Colorado, 80110, United States"

"Background:

Mesothelioma is a rare cancer typically caused by exposure to asbestos and related fibers. Most people with mesothelioma survive less than 5 years after diagnosis. About 3000 people in the United States die from this disease each year. People with inherited mutations in the BAP1 gene \[called BAP1 Cancer Syndrome (BCS)\] are more likely to develop mesothelioma and other cancers such as melanomas and renal cell carcinomas without asbestos exposure. Almost all people with BCS develop multiple cancers, of which mesothelioma is the most commonly observed.

Objective:

To test a study drug (APG-115) in participants with BAP1 Cancer Syndrome (BCS) and early-stage mesothelioma.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with germline BAP1 mutations and early-stage mesothelioma that does not yet need standard treatment are eligible for protocol enrollment. Participants will be required to also enroll in NIH protocols 20-C-0106 and 06-C-0014 which allow for pre- and post-treatment biopsies and bloodwork to be obtained for additional research studies.

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. Their medical records will be reviewed. They will have imaging scans and tests of their heart and lung functions. A procedure using a flexible tube with a camera and light will be inserted into the participant s chest and abdomen through a small cut to look at the tumors and to collect a tissue sample (biopsy).

APG-115 capsules are taken by mouth. Participants will take the drug at home every other day for the first 13 days of the 21-day treatment cycles.

On the first day of each cycle, researchers will call or email participants to check on their health.

Participants will have blood tests 2 times a week during the first 2 cycles; after that, the blood tests will be weekly. These blood tests can be done at a local medical facility or at the NIH Clinical Center.

Participants may continue treatment for up to 16 cycles.

Imaging scans, biopsy, and other tests will be repeated after 8 and 16 cycles.",Mesothelioma|Malignant Mesothelioma (MM)|Early-stage Mesothelioma|Subclinical Mesothelioma|BRCA1-Associated Protein-1 (BAP1) Mutations|Early-stage BAP1-associated Malignancies,ALL,PHASE2,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

"This phase III/IV trial compares the impact of leuprolide and abiraterone acetate (AA) versus relugolix and AA on the heart in hormone-naive patients with advanced prostate cancer receiving pelvic radiation therapy. Leuprolide is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GNRHa). It prevents the body from making luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This causes the testicles to stop making testosterone (a male hormone) in men and may stop the growth of prostate tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. Abiraterone acetate, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body. Relugolix, a GNRH antagonist, works by decreasing the amount of testosterone produced by the body. This may slow or stop the spread of prostate tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. The use of hormone therapy with radiation therapy has been shown to improve survival, however, studies have suggested that the addition of hormone therapy may worsen heart (cardiac) disease and high blood pressure. In fact, studies have shown that the most common cause of death in prostate cancer patients is due to heart disease or heart attacks. Computed tomography (CT) scans create a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body; the pictures are created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. In this study, sophisticated cardiac CT images are used to take pictures of patients' heart and coronary arteries to help assess damage to the heart. Using cardiac CT and blood tests, this trial may help doctors determine which patients are at risk of cardiac disease when treated with combination hormone therapy, as well as the differential risk of leuprolide versus relugolix in combination with abiraterone acetate.",Recurrent Prostate Carcinoma|Stage III Prostate Cancer AJCC V8|Stage IVA Prostate Cancer AJCC V8,MALE,PHASE3,"Emory Proton Therapy Center, Atlanta, Georgia, 30308, United States|Winship at Emory Midtown, Atlanta, Georgia, 30308, United States|Emory University Hospital/Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, 30342, United States"

"This phase I trial studies how well zirconium (Zr)-89 crefmirlimab berdoxam and immuno-positron emission tomography (PET) identifies areas of immune cell activity in patients with brain tumors that can be removed by surgery (resectable). One important predictor of the immune response is the presence and change in CD8 positive (+) tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) cells. Identifying the presence and changes in CD8+ cells can be challenging, particularly for participants with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, and usually requires invasive procedures such as repeat tissue biopsies, which may not accurately represent the immune status of the entire tumor. Zr-89 crefmirlimab berdoxam is known as a radioimmunoconjugate which consists of a radiolabeled anti-CD8+ minibody whose uptake can be imaged with PET. Upon administration, Zr 89 crefmirlimab berdoxam specifically targets and binds to the CD8+ cells. This enables PET imaging and may detect CD8+ T-cell distribution and activity and may help determine the patient's response to cancer immunotherapeutic agents more accurately.

"This study focuses on the mental health challenges faced by the World Trade Center's (WTC) General Responders due to the severe psychological trauma from the WTC collapse. PTSD and depression are among the top mental health conditions affecting these responders. Many members of the WTC Health Program (WTCHP) have relocated to Florida, making up nearly six percent of the cohort. Furthermore, many identify as Latinx, highlighting the need for services in their preferred language to promote health equity. Studies have shown that remotely-delivered, clinician-supported applications (apps) can reduce adverse MH symptoms.

PTSD Coach was developed by the Veteran's Administration as a self-managed mobile app and is available at no cost for Android and Apple devices. The primary focus of PTSD Coach is on managing PTSD symptoms. The app offers coping tools such as relaxation exercises and calming self-talk and effective sleep hygiene practices when needed. A recent review evaluated the self-managed PTSD Coach app and found it to be feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing PTSD symptoms.

Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach was developed as a brief intervention for Veterans who were unlikely to use a mobile app on their own. Clinician Supported PTSD Coach combines PTSD Coach mobile app with four remotely-delivered 20-30 minute sessions over 8 weeks with a clinician. Studies with Veterans have reported significant reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms, treatment satisfaction and more treatment sessions attended, when compared with typical mental health care. While promising, none of these studies included WTC General Responders or focused on Latinx populations.

Given the promise of these interventions, and the need to provide support for geographically dispersed General Responders in Florida, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Clinician Supported PTSD Coach in reducing symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances among English and Spanish-speaking WTC General Responders. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions:

1. Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach
2. Self-Managed PTSD Coach
3. Waitlist Control (no treatment until after follow-up)

Assessments will be conducted at the end of treatment (8 weeks) and at follow-up (12 weeks). The study will measure reductions in PTSD, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances at 8 weeks and 12 weeks. It is expected that both Clinician Supported PTSD Coach and Self-Managed PTSD Coach will reduce symptoms, with Clinician Supported PTSD Coach showing larger reductions. In addition, to assess feasibility and acceptability, the study will assess engagement, satisfaction, and barriers in both PTSD Coach app conditions.

This project aims to fill a significant gap in evidence-based mental health treatments for WTC General Responders. It responds to the WTCHP Scientific Technical Advisory Committee's call for more research on mental health interventions and addresses the critical shortage of rigorously tested app-based remote interventions for dispersed General Responders with PTSD. The study also focuses on Spanish-speaking Latinx General Responders, a group that has not been specifically targeted in previous interventions. The study's findings could lead to the development of readily deployable interventions nationally to meet the mental health needs of WTC responders and survivors, providing a valuable resource for treatment researchers and health care providers.",PTSD Symptoms|Anxiety Symptoms|Depression Symptoms|Sleep Disturbance,ALL,NA,"Florida International University, Miami, Florida, 33199, United States"

Although postoperative ileus may be the result of obstruction or leakage, in most cases postoperative ileus (POI) is the result of local irritation because of fluid overload, exogenous opioids, neurohormonal dysfunction, gastrointestinal stretch, local bleeding and inflammation. POI usually lasts between 2 to 7 days. In most cases, a nasogastric tube (NG tube) is used to relieve that gastric pressure until the resolution of the POI.

"Alcohol consumption is a critical factor in HIV treatment that significantly contributes to poor treatment-related outcomes. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of alcohol interventions for people with HIV (PWH) have had limited success, perhaps due to an increasingly recognized co-morbitity of co-occurring hazardous alcohol use and other mental health-related problems among PWH. This has necessitated a shift in the literature towards trans-diagnostic approaches that target core psychological processes that underlie multiple mental health-related problems. One trans-diagnostic mechanism that is relevant to alcohol and other substance use is experiential avoidance (EA)- i.e., repeated, and maladaptive, use of substances and/or other behaviors to escape or avoid unwanted thoughts, feelings, and/or urges. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) targets EA and is an empirically supported treatment for multiple psychological and behavioral health-related outcomes; however there have not been any full-scale RCTs of ACT for alcohol use among any population, including PWH. The investigators recently adapted a telephone-delivered ACT intervention originally developed for smoking cessation, into an intervention for PWH who drink at unhealthy levels (NIH/NIAAA; R34AA026246). This six-session, telephone-delivered ACT intervention for alcohol use showed high feasibility and acceptability in a pilot RCT conducted by our team. The overall objective of this application is therefore to determine if ACT can significantly reduce alcohol use and comorbid symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among adult PWH who drink at unhealthy levels. The specific aims are: To determine the relative efficacy of ACT, compared to BI, for reducing alcohol use among PWH (Aim 1) and to determine if ACT has an effect on trans-diagnostic processes that in turn affect alcohol use and other psychological and functional outcomes (Aim 2). The investigators will accomplish these aims by: conducting a remote, RCT in which the investigators randomly assign 300 PWH who drink at unhealthy levels to either the ACT intervention the investigators developed (n = 150), or a BI intervention (n = 150) previously shown to reduce alcohol use among PWH. The investigators will assess alcohol-related outcomes-via self-report and a biomarker- at baseline, post-treatment (7 weeks post-baseline), and again 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-randomization.

The procedure is similar to a bone marrow transplant, in that the patient's malfunctioning blood stem cells are reduced or eliminated using chemotherapy, but it is different because instead of using a different person's (donor) blood stem cells for the transplant, the patient's own blood stem cells are given back after the new genetic material has been introduced into those cells. This approach has the advantage of eliminating any risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), reducing the risk of graft rejection, and may also allow less chemotherapy to be utilized for the conditioning portion of the transplant procedure. The method used to fix or replace a diseased gene is called gene editing. A person's own cells are edited using a specialized biological medicine that has been formulated for use in human beings.

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a healthy, non-sickling kind of hemoglobin. Investigators have recently discovered a gene called BCL11A that is very important in the control of fetal hemoglobin expression. Increasing the expression of this gene in sickle cell patients could increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin while simultaneously reducing the amount of sickle hemoglobin in their blood, and therefore potentially cure the condition.","Sickle Cell Disease|Sickle Cell Anemia (HbSS, or HbSÎ²-thalassemia0)|Beta-Thalassemia|Transfusion Dependent Beta-Thalassaemia",ALL,PHASE1,"Boston Children&#39;s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States"

vertical jump test? standing long jump test? Researchers will compare an alternate intervention of foam rolling self-myofascial release to see if any changes in jump test performance are comparable.

Participants will perform a brief warm-up followed by baseline performance of the two jump tests (5 repetitions each). Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: either application of the body tempering intervention or performance of self-myofascial release via foam rolling. Following the intervention, participants will be asked to perform 3 repetitions of each outcome measure (jump test); participants will be asked to return 24 hours later where they will guided through the same warm-up as the day prior and will again perform 5 repetitions of each jump test.",Lower Extremity Muscular Power Performance Output,ALL,NA,"Blatt PE Center, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, 29208, United States"

"This clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy (PSTx) for individuals suffering from chronic insomnia, sleep deprivation, and REM sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep, significantly affects patients and quality of life, mood, and cognitive function. REM sleep disorders, in which the body struggles to enter or maintain restful REM sleep, can worsen these issues. The trial introduces a novel therapy using anesthesia-induced sleep, targeting sleep homeostasis and improving sleep architecture.

Objectives: The primary goals of the trial are to determine:

1. Whether PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy increases the quality of REM sleep.
2. Whether PSTx increases the duration of REM and/or NREM sleep.
3. Whether PSTx decreases the time it takes participants to fall asleep (sleep onset latency).

Participants will receive ONE (1) PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy session lasting between 60-120 minutes. Each session uses Diprivan/Propofol to induce sleep, and is monitored via an EEG to ensure proper sleep stages, particularly REM sleep.

Participant Criteria:

Inclusion: Adults aged 18-65 with diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic insomnia or sleep deprivation.

Exclusion: Patients with severe obesity, significant cardiovascular, neurological, or psychiatric conditions, or those with an ASA status above II.

Study Design: This trial is non-randomized, single-arm and open-label, with all participants receiving the PSTx. The trial does not include a comparison group, as the focus is on evaluating the immediate, direct effects of the therapy.

Participants will undergo continuous EEG monitoring during therapy sessions, allowing researchers to track brain activity and sleep stages in real-time. This method ensures that sleep cycles, particularly REM sleep, are optimized for therapeutic benefit.

Therapy Methodology:

PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy leverages anesthesia to mimic natural sleep patterns and enhance the efficiency of REM sleep. Diprivan/Propofol is used to induce REM sleep, while EEG monitoring tracks and maintains proper sleep architecture throughout the session. The therapy promotes the clearance of adenosine, a compound that builds up during wakefulness and drives the need for sleep. Adenosine is cleared during REM sleep, reducing sleep pressure and improving cognitive function.

Outcome Measures:

Primary Outcomes: Researchers will measure the increase in REM sleep duration, improvement in sleep quality (via self-reported questionnaires), and a reduction in sleep onset latency.

Secondary Outcomes: These include changes in mood, cognitive function, and blood serum uric acid levels. Patient-reported outcomes will also be tracked through tools like the PROSOMNIA Sleep Quiz, which is specifically designed for PSTx.

Significance: Chronic insomnia and REM sleep disorders affect millions globally, leading to cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and poor overall health. Traditional treatments, including pharmacological approaches and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), often provide suboptimal results for many individuals. PSTx offers a novel, therapeutic approach to restoring sleep balance and enhancing the overall quality of sleep, particularly for those who have not responded to conventional treatments.

Study Process:

Recruitment and Baseline Assessments: Participants undergo a comprehensive sleep assessment, including sleep questionnaires and polysomnography, to establish a baseline for sleep quality and duration. Blood serum uric acid levels will also be measured to track any biochemical changes due to therapy.

Therapy Sessions: Only one (1) PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy session will be administered, with the session lasting between 60-120 minutes. Diprivan/Propofol is used to induce sleep, and EEG will monitor brain activity to ensure the proper balance of sleep stages.

Post-Therapy Follow-up: Follow-up assessments will occur at 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days post-treatment. Researchers will analyze the therapy effects on REM sleep, mood, cognitive function, and other health indicators.

Potential Implications: If successful, this trial could revolutionize how we treat sleep disorders by targeting the underlying mechanisms of sleep pressure and REM sleep disruption. PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy may offer a safe, effective, and immediate alternative for patients who have exhausted other treatment options.

Key Concepts:

"The US is currently going through an opioid crisis, and while Medication Assisted Treatments such as buprenorphine (BUP) have proved highly effective at stabilizing the neurobiology underlying acute withdrawal, they have been less effective at preventing longer-term relapse and adherence. This may be due to the fact that they do not fully engage the neural processes sub-serving the emotional control of sensitized negative mood and reward sensitivity during stress- and opioid-cue provocation, respectively. In contrast while the alpha2 agonist, guanfacine, may attenuate stress-provoked opioid craving by mediating top-down prefrontal control over sensitized dysphoria, the behavioral intervention, Mindfulness Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) may reduce opioid cue-provoked craving by mediating top-down prefrontal control over hedonic dysregulation. Furthermore, while both interventions separately may prove effective as longer-term adjunctive therapies, they may offer greater efficacy together, providing a unique medication/behavioral combination able to target both stress and reward provocation mechanisms. To optimally test this hypothesis, a staged approach is proposed to first confirm the efficacy of both GXR and MORE, independently and combined (R61), prior to elucidating underlying neural mechanisms (R33). Using a 2 X 2 design, N=80 OUD individuals on BUP will be randomized to either 6-weeks of Guanfacine extended release (GXR; 3mgs, n=40) or placebo (PBO; n=40). Half of all participants in each group will then receive either weekly MORE, or a Support Group (SG) control, creating four intervention groups (Control Grp: PBO+SG, n=20); (GXR Grp: GXR+SG, n=20); (MORE Grp: PBO+ MORE, n=20); (Combined Grp: GXR+MORE, n=20). A pre- and post-laboratory study will be conducted before and after six weeks of intervention where participants will be randomly exposed to 3 personalized guided imageries (stress, opioid cue, neutral). Subjective measures of opioid craving, anxiety, mood, stress, emotional reappraisal, and heart rate will be collected before and after imagery exposure. Following milestone completion, an identical design is proposed in N=144 individuals, where participants will be exposed to imageries in the MRI scanner (R33). On the basis of prior research, it is hypothesized in that GXR will attenuate opioid craving and improve emotion regulation during stress, while MORE will demonstrate the same effects during opioid cue exposure. Combined GXR and MORE will also demonstrate additive or synergistic improvements compared with each intervention alone (R61). The effects of GXR on opioid cue- and MORE on stress-provoked opioid seeking will be explored. In the R33 component, it is hypothesized that GXR will improve regulatory and affective brain function during stress, and MORE will improve regulatory and reward function during opioid cue exposure. Combined GXR and MORE may improve regulatory function in an additive or synergistic manner (R33).

"Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is a common symptom of many neurological diseases but its treatment is not well established or easily accessible.

To start addressing this gap, the researchers developed and validated a cost-effective wearable surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback sensor technology (i-Phagia), optimized to record muscle activity from the head/neck and provide biofeedback to patients and adherence data to clinicians during swallow therapy. This system has been developed with commercially available and widely used materials and the Purdue University IRB has determined that the device is non-significant risk device.

The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if this biofeedback (using this new technology/i-Phagia) when used as an adjunct to a standard swallow therapy protocol works to improve swallowing function in patients post chronic stroke or diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. It will also help the investigators learn whether this therapy protocol is equally effective when provided in-person versus via telehealth. Finally, it will determine which patient factors may influence how well the treatment works.

Microbiome disruption, dysbiosis, can impair the immune response to infection.

Despite recent evidence that suggests dysbiosis may be implicated in PJI, the role of probiotics in the treatment of PJI is unknown. Perioperative probiotics have been demonstrated to be safe and effective for infection prevention in abdominal surgery. The investigators hypothesize that perioperative probiotics will reduce re-infection in patients treated for PJI.

"The development of efficacious medications for AUD remains a high research priority with current emphases on identifying novel molecular targets and efficiently screening new compounds. Pharmacological modulation of the kynurenine pathway (KP) represents a promising novel target for AUD. The KP is a complex enzymatic cascade with each step producing biologically active metabolites that are critically involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Chronic alcohol exposure produces dysregulation of the KP, particularly as evidenced by decreased levels of the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) and increased levels of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN). This metabolic shift is associated with various alcohol-related pathologies in animals and humans. Thus, a medication that targets the KP to restore KYNA and attenuate QUIN levels may be an effective treatment for AUD. The enzyme kynurenine 3- monooxygenase (KMO) is a major gatekeeper of the KP and resultant KYNA levels. KMO inhibition shifts the KP towards KYNA production in brain and away from QUIN production. Critically, KMO inhibition in rodents, through its increase in brain KYNA levels, decreases alcohol self-administration, preference, cue-reactivity, and relapse behaviors. However, KMO-inhibitors have not been tested in humans because of presumed lack of availability. Diclofenac is an FDA-approved Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug that was recently discovered to inhibit KMO activity. Consistent with KMO inhibition, diclofenac increases KYNA levels in the brain and periphery of rodents. However, it remains unknown whether diclofenac increases KYNA levels and affects alcohol-related behaviors in humans at approved, safe dosages.

Investigators propose to conduct a human laboratory pilot study to test whether diclofenac can increase KYNA in individuals with AUD, and if so, which of 3 doses (50, 75, or 100 mg) most effectively increases KYNA. Individuals with AUD (n = 24) will complete four sessions where they receive diclofenac (50, 75, or 100 mg) or placebo.

"Purpose:

Aim 1: Quantify soft tissue complications and infections of service members with transtibial amputations treated with OPRA OI and compare them to transfemoral OI service members.

Aim 2: Compare the validated domains, such as functional, quality of life and pain scores, from the preoperative baseline to follow-up visits to determine if persons with transtibial amputations treated with OPRA osseointegrated prostheses demonstrate statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements.

Aim 3: Compare physical performance measures preoperatively to follow-up visits for persons with transtibial amputations treated with OPRA osseointegrated prostheses to quantify statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements.

Aim 4: Quantify the biomechanical loading and bone quality changes that are directly associated with patient reported outcomes for persons with transtibial amputations treated with OPRA osseointegration.

Aim 5: Compare outcome measures between persons with traditional socket prostheses (patients as self-controls) and OPRA OI devices as well as a comparison between persons with transtibial OI and transfemoral OI.

Subject Population:

Male and female military health care beneficiaries age 22 to 65 years old presenting with a Transtibial limb loss.

Study Design:

This is a 4-year, prospective cohort FDA pivotal study involving off-label use of the OPRA OI implant in persons with transtibial amputation.

Procedures:

SURGICAL PROCEDURES:

Surgery Stage I:

The distal part of the tibia is exposed, preferably using existing incisions, to produce an appropriate fasciocutaneous flap. By the use of fluoroscopy and guiding devices the correct position of the fixture in the medullary canal is found. The canal is reamed step by step to a proper diameter to facilitate insertion of the implant. If the bone quality is poor, as determined by the operating surgeon, autologous bone graft from the iliac crest and/or the medullary canal is used. The fixture is then implanted into the intramedullary canal. Careful surgical technique is essential not to damage the tissue and to achieve osseointegration. A central screw, healing cylinder, and healing bolt are inserted. A myodesis is performed, and the wound is closed using suture.

The sutures are removed 2-3 weeks postoperatively. When the skin is completely healed the Patient's conventional socket prosthesis could, in some instances, be used.

Surgery Stage II (3-5 months after Stage I):

The tibia is exposed via the incision from the Stage I-Surgery. The healing cylinder is removed and the tissues are trimmed in a way that the distal end of the bone protrudes a few millimeters. The skin will be attached directly to it. The endosteal canal is reamed to facilitate placement of the abutment. The skin in the abutment area is then trimmed to a diameter equal to the protruding end of the tibia. This is done to remove the subcutaneous fat and facilitate healing of the dermal layer to the distal end of the bone. The subcutaneous tissue is affixed to the periosteum using absorbable suture to prevent skin movement. A 8mm punch biopsy tool is used to create a circular hole in the skin precisely over the residual tibial canal. The remaining portion of the fasciocutaneous flap is sutured into position. A bolster dressing is placed and routine postoperative wound care is performed by daily dressing changes. Sutures are removed 2-3 weeks postoperatively.

CLINICAL PROCEDURES

A pre-study visit will be conducted up to 6 months prior to Surgery Stage I. Postoperative visits will occur 2-3 weeks after each surgery. Additional follow-up visits will occur 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-Surgery Stage II. It is standard of care to follow patients postoperatively from time to time to ensure the wound(s) is /are healing, surveil for complications, and ensure rehabilitation is progressing. That said, the sole reason for engaging in the Clinical Follow-Up Procedures is for the purpose of conducting research under this particular protocol. Additional visits may occur including x-rays at the discretion of the clinical investigator in order to monitor the participants medical status/bone healing.

"This phase II trial studies how well hypofractionated radiotherapy before (preoperative) or after (postoperative) breast surgery works in treating patients with different types of non-metastatic (has not spread from original tumor site) breast cancer and to determine the outcomes and side effects of this treatment. Radiation therapy is considered an integral part of breast conserving therapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day. This has been shown to be an effective treatment for breast cancer while reducing treatment time and decreasing side effects. Preoperative radiotherapy alone or concurrently with chemotherapy has also been tested with excellent results and with minimal toxicity. Preoperative radiation of the intact tumor with a hypofractionated regimen can potentially decrease toxicity by allowing the delivery of treatment to intact breast tissue. The potential advantages of preoperative radiation therapy include the delivery of radiation in the intact breast when radiation can be more effective as more oxygen can be available in the tissue. Furthermore, complications and cosmetic results are expected to be lower in pre-operative radiotherapy before surgery, as there have been no changes in blood supply to the breast. This lends to the possibility of using lower doses of radiotherapy to patients, and potentially better cancer associated clinical outcomes for our breast cancer patients. Undergoing hypofractionated radiation therapy before or after breast surgery may be safe and effective in treating patients with different types of non-metastatic breast cancer.",Anatomic Stage I Breast Cancer AJCC v8|Anatomic Stage II Breast Cancer AJCC v8|Anatomic Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC v8|Breast Carcinoma|Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,FEMALE,PHASE2,"Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States"

"Background:

Cushing syndrome (CS) is a set of diseases that develop when the body produces too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH stimulates the production of a hormone called cortisol. Excess cortisol can cause serious issues, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, weight gain, and mood changes. Diagnosing CS early can be difficult. One test used to diagnose CS, the desmopressin (Desmo) stimulation test (DesmoST), has not been studied in enough people to know how accurate it is.

Objective:

To find ways to improve the DesmoST. Researchers especially want to learn more about how well the DesmoST identifies people with specific ACTH CSs: Cushing disease (CD) and ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS).

Eligibility:

People aged 18 to 70 years who have or may have CS, especially CD or EAS. Healthy volunteers are also needed.

Design:

Participants with CS will have 3 DesmoSTs at least 48 hours apart. The procedure for each is as follows:

They will limit their fluid intake the day before each test. They will have nothing to eat or drink for 12 hours before the test.

For 1 of the tests, they will take a pill that contains a hormone (dexamethasone). They will take it around 11 pm the day before the test.

Desmo is given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein.

Blood will be drawn a total of 6 times before and after the desmo is given.

"Hospital stays are stressful for the family and friends who care for adults with dementia. Following hospital discharge, adults with dementia often have increased care needs, which places new caregiving demands on their family and friends. Family and friends are critical to ensuring that Veterans with dementia can live safely in the community following discharge. Healthcare systems have an opportunity to support family and friends of adults with dementia by addressing dementia-specific caregiving challenges that arise during the transition from hospital to home.

The investigators are comparing two different support programs for family and friends of hospitalized adults with dementia. The two programs are Hospital GamePlan4Care and Caregiver Education. Hospital GamePlan4Care was developed with feedback from people who care for Veterans with dementia. Hospital GamePlan4Care helps caregivers build skills to care for someone with dementia recently discharged from the hospital. It includes a written handbook, online training on the Hospital GamePlan4Care website, and phone calls with a dementia care specialist. The online training is tailored to the caregiver. The Caregiver Education program provides information that helps caregivers care for someone recently hospitalized. It includes a written handbook, recommendations for high-quality online resources, and phone calls with a dementia care specialist.

Both programs will start when the adult with dementia is hospitalized. Each program lasts at least three months. To be eligible, the caregiver must care for a Veteran with dementia admitted to the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, Texas.

"Vascular dysfunction is a common factor in many chronic debilitating diseases, contributing to morbidity and mortality. With the onset of chronic disease or exposure to stress, the vasculature displays an inability to adequately respond to increased blood flow demands, manifesting in a reduced ability or altered mechanism of vasodilation. Aging is an independent risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, and reduces vasodilator capacity, or alters the mechanism by which vasodilation occurs in multiple vascular beds. Chronic exercise/physical activity is one of the most potent ways to enhance vascular function, resulting in favorable outcomes such as reductions in blood pressure, and improved ability to perform activities of daily living. Barriers to exercise or failure of long-term adherence preclude many populations from the cardiovascular benefits of exercise, thus further enhancing cardiovascular risk. Avenues to mimic blood flow patterns observed with exercise may exert beneficial effects without the need for the ability to exercise. Recent evidence has demonstrated that passive heat therapy, or chronic heat exposure (\~ +1Â°C in core temperature) results in reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, blood pressure and improved large artery endothelial function, primarily through preservation of large artery function in response to vascular stress. It is unclear whether microvascular function is augmented in response to acute heat exposure, or whether this can protect against vascular insults particularly in older adults. Some preliminary evidence in humans suggest that autophagy, a cell recycling process is involved in the beneficial cardiovascular effects, as short-term heat exposure upregulates markers of autophagy. Previous evidence from our lab indicates that autophagy governs the mechanism by which microvascular vasodilation occurs. The role of autophagy in mediating the beneficial effects of passive heating is unknown.",Aging,ALL,NA,"Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States"

"The investigators propose to expand our previous work to test whether 10 repeated administrations of the cTBS procedure over a two-week period can lead to longer-term improvements in sleep, perhaps up to 3-months. For this 3-year study, 120 people with insomnia will be recruited to participate. There will be an initial screening, with the first consent form being for the screening questions, a psychological interview, and a one night at home sleep monitoring session with our equipment. If participants pass this first phase, they will reconsent for the main portion of the study. They will then undergo a physical examination, then a week-long at-home monitoring phase where they will wear a wristwatch sleep monitor as well as wear a portable brain wave monitor to bed each night to record sleep. Participants will continue to use this equipment throughout the treatment phase and for one week post treatment. After the first monitoring phase, each participant will be randomly assigned to one of four different conditions (i.e., 30 assigned to each group). Three of the conditions will involve cTBS focused on different brain locations (i.e., stimulation to the middle front, middle back, or side of the skull), while the fourth condition will provide inactive sham stimulation as a control. All participants will complete 10 treatment visits to the lab over two-to-three weeks, during which they will get a brief cTBS or sham stimulation each time. In addition, all participants will complete a brain scanning and cognitive testing session at the beginning and end of the two-to-three week treatment period.

"The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a study drug called eltrombopag can improve the blood cell counts in patients with low-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) with mutations in TET2 gene, observe changes in the TET2 gene over time, and evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. TET2 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes (altered parts of the DNA) in MDS and CMML.

Eltrombopag is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia and low levels of platelets in patients with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and chronic hepatitis C. Eltrombopag is considered investigational (experimental) in this study because the FDA has not approved its use in the treatment of low-risk MDS or CMML. Eltrombopag is a drug that helps stimulate the body's process of making more platelets (small components of blood that help with clotting) by interacting with specific parts of cells. This interaction starts a series of signals that encourage the growth and development of the cells that produce platelets. It was found that this drug could stop the growth of TET2 mutated cells.",Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia,ALL,PHASE2,"Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, 44195, United States"

"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Alaska Native men and the second leading cause of death (after cancer) among women and Alaska Native people overall. The overarching goal of the proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention, Diet and Active Lifestyle - Yuuyaraq (DAiLY), is to reduce consumption of highly processed store-bought foods while promoting intake of subsistence foods, healthy store-bought foods, and a more active lifestyle to reduce heart disease risk. The Yup\&amp;amp;#39;ik word Yuuyaraq means 'the Yup'ik way of life' and encompasses a worldview in which living in harmony with the environment, as well as sharing of subsistence foods and traditional knowledge is central. The proposed DAiLY intervention is grounded in the Yup'ik worldview and Indigenous Food Sovereignty, and supported by a foundation of trust resulting from 22 years of continuous Community Based Participatory Research on heart disease risk andprotective factors with Yup'ik communities. DAiLY is a direct response to the intervention research requests of community partners and input from Yup'ik Community Research Associates and a Yup'ik Community Planning Group during the formative research and community engagement process shaping this proposal. The proposed intervention, based on the Warnecke model of health disparities and social cognitive theory, includes three components: 1) home-based workshops, framed in the Yupik worldview, led by Community Research Associates to facilitate interactive discussions with community members about healthy market foods, as well as the health benefits of locally harvested traditional foods and increased physical activity; 2) local food store interventions to increase access to, and help build demand for, healthy food options; and 3) traditional community activities, including Yuraq (Yup'ik traditional dance), Native sports events, and berry festivals, that provide opportunities to increase physical activity. The three components will be supported and reinforced via community media, including Facebook, text messaging and visual materials. A continuous metabolic syndrome score will be used as the primary outcome to assess changes in heart disease risk, and objective stable isotope biomarkers of diet and a validated food frequency questionnaire will be used to measure intake of traditional and market foods. We will test the DAiLY intervention in four Yupik communities, randomized to immediate and delayed intervention. Aim 1, will determine the effectiveness of the DAiLY intervention on heart disease risk by measuring change in a continuous metabolic syndrome risk score (primary outcome). Aim 2, will assess implementation of the DAiLY intervention using a mixed methods process evaluation to determine fidelity, dose, and reach, as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation of program activities and participant satisfaction and engagement. Aim 3, will determine the impact of the DAiLY intervention on community-level outcomes, including access to, and sales of, healthy foods in local stores, as well as opportunities for physical activity at community venues.",Heart Disease,ALL,NA,"Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, 97239-3098, United States"

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in T1D, which begins as early as adolescence, and current therapies are limited. Therefore, this study plans to investigate whether cardiometabolic health can be improved with increased sleep duration and advanced circadian timing in adolescents with T1D with habitually insufficient sleep. To answer this question, investigators will study adolescents with T1D who get \&lt;7h sleep on school nights and measure changes in insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and vascular function after one month of a sleep and circadian intervention (1+ hour longer time in bed each night plus evening melatonin and morning light therapy) compared to one month of typical sleep (usual school schedule).",Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)|Sleep Health,ALL,NA,"Children&#39;s Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States"

"This research project addresses the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to overcome chemotherapy resistance and mitigate chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients with recurrent ovarian and endometrial cancers, which are among the most lethal gynecologic malignancies worldwide. The study focuses on BMX-001, a redox-active manganese metalloporphyrin compound that uniquely combines the ability to enhance anti-tumor efficacy and protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of chemotherapy, specifically paclitaxel (PTX). PTX, despite being a cornerstone of treatment, is associated with significant dose-limiting neurotoxicity, which severely impacts patients quality of life and limits the use of subsequent therapies. BMX-001 has demonstrated potential in preclinical models to not only augment the anti-tumor effects of PTX but also reduce PTX-induced neuropathy.

The research will be conducted through a single-site, Phase 1/2 clinical trial led by the Duke Cancer Institute. The trial aims to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of BMX-001 when combined with weekly PTX and to evaluate the clinical activity of this combination therapy. Specifically, the trial will assess the safety, tolerability, and potential to double the dose of BMX-001, which is hypothesized to further enhance the efficacy of PTX without increasing toxicity. The study\&#39;s specific aims include establishing the recommended dose for expansion, assessing objective response rates (ORR), and quantifying the reduction in PTX-induced neurotoxicity using validated questionnaires and monofilament testing. The project also incorporates the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for treatment response, adding a layer of precision to the evaluation of the therapy response impact on tumor burden.

The outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly improve treatment protocols for patients with chemo-resistant gynecologic cancers by offering a therapy that enhances tumor control while protecting against debilitating side effects. Successful completion of this trial will lay the groundwork for larger, definitive trials and may extend the benefits of BMX-001 to other solid tumors, ultimately contributing to better survival outcomes and quality of life for a broader patient population.","Ovarian Neoplasms|Endometrial Cancer, Endometrial Neoplasm",FEMALE,PHASE1|PHASE2,"Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States"

"Suicide in youth is rapidly growing to where it is the second leading cause of death across the United States. Use of available tools have shown the potential to boost primary care providers' (PCPs) detection of suicide risk and confidence and knowledge around addressing it; however, ways that work to address clinic and provider barriers that influence the ongoing implementation of a pathway to manage at-risk patients remain under researched. The proposed study will assess the impact of the investigators Facilitated Suicide Prevention program--which provides support to assist practices in integrating screening, assessment, data analysis and management procedures into routine care through feedback and coaching--on clinic use of the suicide prevention pathway and youth suicide.

The project hypothesizes that compared to PCPs in Training Only (TO) practices, those in TO+Practice Facilitation (PF) may rate the care pathway as more able to be carried out and acceptable; demonstrate greater use of the pathway components (screening, risk assessment, safety planning, lethal means safety counseling, referrals and follow-up); demonstrate higher levels of use of the pathway suicide prevention skills ; and report higher levels of confidence putting the care pathway into use.

Also we predict that, compared to youth who screen positive for suicide risk and are followed by PCPs in TO practices, those who screen positive and are followed by PCPs in TO+PF practices will be less likely to attempt suicide during the next six months; less likely to have suicidal ideation during the next 6 months; more likely to see a behavioral health provider during the next 6 months; and less likely to be sent to Emergency Departments during the next 6 months .",Suicide Prevention,ALL,NA,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States"

"The availability of Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) has dramatically altered the management of heart failure (HF) patients, independently of their ejection fraction and glycemic status. A meta-analysis of 57 studies comparing SGLT2-I monotherapy vs. placebo or active comparator showed reductions in major cardiovascular events, but no impact on atherothrombotic events. In fact, a non-significant increase in the risk for non-fatal stroke was observed. Similar trend observed in multiple trials indicate a SGLT2-i class effect. Sotagliflozin is the first dual SGLT1/2 receptor inhibitor, that was shown to significantly reduce atherothrombotic events compared with placebo in diabetic HF patients, suggesting that dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor may have additional properties vs. SGLT2-i. The hypothesis of this study is that dual SGLT1/2 inhibition by sotagliflozin improves thrombogenic profile (i.e. reduces thrombus formation), which could make it a safer and more effective treatment option for cardiovascular (CV) patients than SGLT2-i. To test the hypothesis, the researchers will compare the antithrombotic activity of sotagliflozin vs. empagliflozin in healthy volunteers using a randomized, cross-over study design, where each participant will receive both study treatments (sotagliflozin and empagliflozin) separated by a washout period.

"The gut microbiome is made up of the microbes (such as bacteria, viruses, and other organisms too small to see with the naked eye) that live in the digestive tract and has been shown to be important in metabolizing food, extracting vitamins and nutrients from food, and maintaining a healthy gut lining. The gut microbiome plays an important role in overall health and has been shown to dynamically change in response to early-stage triple-negative breast cancer-directed therapies, which in turn has been associated with worse outcomes. As the gut microbiome can be further modulated with dietary changes during cancer treatment, it is an ideal potential modifiable risk factor in cancer patients. However, due to multiple confounding factors such as dietary intake, mood, and activity, its utility as part of the oncologic clinical assessment remains unclear.

In this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators propose to recruit up to 30 early-stage TNBC patients to randomize to a personalized nutritional intervention of a high-fiber diet coached by a registered dietician versus educational handout alone during neoadjuvant treatment. The investigators propose to study the gut microbiota through stool sample analysis among early-stage triple-negative breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant (i.e. before surgery) chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy. The investigators will also study how the gut microbiota can be further modulated with a high-fiber diet, and the investigators hypothesize that a high-fiber diet may play a protective role in preserving gut microbial diversity. As part of the nutritional intervention, the investigators propose to administer nutritional counseling with a registered dietitian (RD) to increase fiber intake and tracking performance status, activity, and mood during neoadjuvant treatment. Finally, the investigators propose to survey participants after study completion through one-on-one interviews to determine whether participants experienced improved overall patient satisfaction in supportive care during their treatment.",Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Early Stage Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,ALL,NA,"Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States"

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a FOLR1 on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, are given to a patient before the manufactured FH-FOLR1 CAR T cells are infused back into the patient to assist in the CAR T cell activity in the patient.

"Background:

Lung problems develop in up to 20% of people after they have surgery. While under general anesthesia, people breathe slower and draw in less air. They may have difficulty returning to normal deep breathing as they recover. Some may develop life-threatening complications. An approved device called an incentive spirometer is used to help measure and improve a person s breathing after surgery. Researchers want to find out if a motion sensor placed on the chest can also measure the volume of air a person inhales as they breathe.

Objective:

To determine if a motion sensor on the chest can measure the volume of air a person breathes.

Eligibility:

Healthy adults aged 18 years and older.

Design:

Participants will have 1 clinic visit. The visit will last 10 to 30 minutes.

They will fill out a form with their age, sex, height, and weight.

A small, plastic motion sensor will be taped to their chest on 1 or both sides.

Participants will breathe through a tube attached to an incentive spirometer. They will take 18 breaths of different volumes, both deep and shallow.

"The below summarizes relevant information for investigator(s) to consider the use of Allogenic Human Amniotic Fluid product in a clinical protocol detailing study design and conduct for a phase I/II randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of NANOVAE injected intra-articularly in patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis. The IB will be reviewed annually and amended when further information becomes available.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints that affects millions of people worldwide, yet its exact causes are not fully understood. Middle-aged to elderly individuals are often the most impacted by OA, which primarily affects the knee, hip, spine, and joints in the fingers. Among these, knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the most common form, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced functionality, and it is a major contributor to chronic bone and muscle pain. It is also a leading cause of disability in adults who are not living in institutions. Treatment for KOA is challenging due to its resistance to medications, procedures, and surgeries. The primary objective is to alleviate pain and enhance overall function. However, since there is currently no cure for OA, the need for an effective therapy remains urgent. Healthcare professionals often encounter patients whose pain may result from an inflammatory response triggered by injury or disease. Research suggests that regenerative medicine, utilizing techniques like stem cells, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), amniotic fluid, and cytokine modulation, holds promise for treating KOA.

OA is associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory substances such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokine-inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These inflammatory agents affect various cell types within the affected joints, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, synoviocytes, and macrophages. Some miRNAs, which are downregulated in OA, have been identified as protective factors. For example, miR-130 helps regulate TNF-Î± levels, while miR-149 controls several inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-Î±. The breakdown of the cartilage matrix is a key characteristic of OA. MMP-13, a member of the MMP family, plays a significant role in degrading the collagen network during OA development. Several miRNAs, including miR-27b, miR-27a, miR-148a, miR-320, miR-127-5p, and miR-411, are downregulated in OA and target the mRNA of this proteinase. It is important to note that a single miRNA can regulate multiple target genes associated with OA progression. For instance, miR-105 and miR-148, both downregulated in OA, target genes such as Runx2, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, ADAMTS7, ADAMTS12, MMP-13, and COL10, implying their potential protective roles.

Several studies have shown a link between certain miRNAs, aging, and the progression of OA. For example, miR-320c is downregulated in aging OA samples and regulates ADAMTS5, suggesting that this miRNA may serve as a protective factor by enhancing chondrogenesis.",Knee Osteoarthritis,ALL,PHASE1|PHASE2,"Bluetail Medical Group, Chesterfield, Missouri, 63005, United States"

"Background:

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is cancer that has spread beyond the colon and rectum. Most people with mCRC die within 5 years. New immune-based treatments are making progress with some types of colon cancer. But these treatments do little for people with a type of cancer that is microsatellite stable (MSS). MSS is a specific cancer biomarker. Better treatments are needed.

Objective:

To test 2 drugs (tiragolumab and atezolizumab) combined with radiation therapy in people with MSS mCRC.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with MSS mCRC.

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. They will have imaging scans and a test of their heart function. They will provide a tissue sample from their tumor; if one is not already available, a new sample will be taken. Their ability to perform normal tasks will be assessed.

Tiragolumab and atezolizumab are both administered through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein. Participants will receive both drugs on day 1 of 3-week treatment cycles. Each study visit should last about 8 hours.

Participants will receive radiation therapy on days 1, 3, and 5 of cycle 1 only.

Blood samples and rectal swabs will be collected on day 1 of every cycle.

Imaging scans will be repeated every 9 weeks. Additional tumor samples may be taken during treatment.

"Heart disease is the leading cause of death among men and women. In 2017, more than 400,000 of the one million deaths among women in the United States were related to cardiovascular disease, mostly due to atherosclerotic ischemic heart disease. Ischemic heart disease in women is different from that of men. Women have a unique phenotype with fewer calcified lesions and more non-obstructive disease (\&lt;50% diameter narrowing). Among symptomatic women presenting for invasive coronary angiography, 40-65% have non-obstructive coronary artery disease. They often receive no specific therapy. Women suffering from non-obstructive coronary artery disease represent a large population of untreated or poorly treated patients.

Women with anginal symptoms associated with non-obstructive coronary disease have an elevated risk for major adverse cardiac events, a high symptom burden and reduced quality of life. Anginal symptoms associated with non-obstructive coronary disease creates substantial economic impact with frequent time missed from work and productivity limitations. Although the underlying mechanisms of disease are incompletely understood, coronary endothelial and/or microvascular dysfunction has been implicated. To date, few appropriately designed trials of therapeutic strategies targeting women with anginal symptoms associated with non-obstructive coronary disease and persistent symptoms exist.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, a new drug class approved for the treatment of diabetes, has been shown to significantly reduce atherosclerotic events, hospitalization from heart failure, cardiovascular and total mortality, and progression of chronic kidney disease. In preclinical models of myocardial infarction, dapagliflozin has demonstrated attenuation of cardiac fibrosis and adverse tissue remodeling and improved cardiac function. Furthermore, empagliflozin has been shown to improve coronary microvascular function and increase cardiac output in mice. These findings suggest that Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors therapy may have beneficial impact in women.

The study team hypothesizes that Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors treatment will improve Coronary Microvascular Disease in women with anginal symptoms associated with non-obstructive coronary disease by several pathways, including reducing markers of systemic Inflammation and improving coronary blood flow, leading to a reduction of the functional impact of this disease process. The hypothesis will be addressed through the following three aims:

* Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors treatment improves coronary microvascular disease in women with no evidence of epicardial obstructive coronary artery disease.
* Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors treatment improves angina symptoms and other quality of life measurements associated with the improvement of CFR.
* AIM 3: Identify the effect of Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition on inflammation pathways and markers of systemic",Angina Patients with Non-obstructive Coronary Artery Disease|Coronary Microvascular Disease|Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD),FEMALE,PHASE1,"UVA Health, Charlottesville, Virginia, 22908, United States"

"This study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering AZA in conjunction with steroids as first line therapy for GI GVHD.

A risk for patients who have received a transplant from another donor is graft versus host disease (GVHD). This happens because of differences between the donated cells (graft) and the patient body's cells (host). The new cells from the donor might see the patients body's cells as different and attack them. GVHD can be very serious and cause death. The standard first treatment for GVHD is corticosteroids but not all patients respond and they then have to receive other treatments. In addition, when GHVD involves the gut it can damage stem cells and can cause long term gut problems such as abdominal pain bowel disturbance. In laboratory studies giving a medicine called 5 -azacytidine (AZA) has been able to protect the gut stem cells and help them recover. In this trial the investigators would like to see if AZA can do the same thing when given with steroids in patients with GVHD.

Right now, doctors and researchers don't know the best treatment for GVHD. Acute GVHD is usually treated using high-dose corticosteroids, but these don't always work well. Even if the GVHD gets better when it involves the gut there can be long term damage to gut stem cells. In the laboratory 5 azacytidine (AZA) has been able to protect gut stem cells and help them recover and the investigators would like to learn if this happens in people too.

AZA has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with leukemias.

"There is a growing sector of modern tobacco-free oral nicotine pouches that are federally regulated as non-medicinal nicotine/tobacco products. While nicotine pouches employ marketing approaches that may attract current tobacco users, such as marketing themes connoting minimal harm, information on the long-term health effects of nicotine pouches is lacking. nicotine pouches may appeal to younger adults because they are available in similar product characteristics (e.g., nicotine concentration, protonated nicotine) that many younger people prefer to use in e-cigarettes. In addition, nicotine pouches may be of particular interest to younger adult e-cigarette users because these products can be used discreetly where vaping is not allowed, which may translate into an increased likelihood of becoming dual users of e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. Indeed, approximately 15% young adults who used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days were past 30-day nicotine pouch users. Manufacturers of modern nicotine pouches use acid additives to lower pH, which changes nicotine from a free-base to a protonated nicotine, resulting in improved appeal and sensory experience and higher abuse liability. Thus, nicotine concentration and pH in modern nicotine pouches should be focal targets for regulatory policies. Evidence is also lacking on mechanisms mediating differences in product appeal and abuse liability of nicotine pouches across products varying in nicotine concentration and pH level. The scientific objective of this research is to assess the effect of variation in nicotine concentration in nicotine pouches and its interaction effect with pH level on the proximal outcomes of relevance to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulation: sensory attributes and product appeal among younger adults who use nicotine pouches in the past 30 days (current dual users of nicotine pouches and e-cigarettes and/or combustible cigarettes will be eligible) and are unmotivated to quit nicotine use. This innovative project proposes to conduct a double-blind within-subject randomized study in which participants (N = 72) will administer nicotine pouches varied by nicotine concentration (e.g., 3 vs 6 mg) and pH (e.g., 8.5 or greater vs. less than 8.5) to achieve the project aim: to evaluate the effects of nicotine concentration and pH on subjective product appeal and sensory attributes of nicotine pouches.

"The goal of this trial test two known effective asthma strategies. Treatment guidelines recommend combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) inhaled medications. This strategy is known as MART (maintenance and reliever therapy). The second strategy is PARTICS (patient activated reliever triggered ICS) strategy instructs patients to use an ICS metered dose inhaler (ICS) each time they use their rescue inhaler. In addition, they are instructed to take 5 puffs of the ICS after each rescue nebulizer use. PARTICS has been shown to reduce exacerbations, increase asthma control and quality of life, however, the question remains if PARTICS is as effective as MART and therefore be an alternative to MART. This trial will test PARTICS and MART head-to-head.

The trial will include adults with moderate-to-severe asthma at risk for an asthma exacerbation, currently using a combination ICS.

The main questions aim to answer:

* Is PARTICS as effective as SMART?
* Might PARTICS be more effective than SMART? Is the relative effectiveness of PARTICS versus SMART affected by frequent nebulizer use for asthma relief?
* Do PARTICS and SMART diverge in terms of their effectiveness on differing asthma outcomes important to patients?
* Do socioeconomic factors affect the relative effectiveness of PARTICS and SMART? Researchers will compare non frequent nebulizer (NFN) users - less than once a week to frequent nebulizer users - once a week or more, to assess whether the PARTICS strategy is ono-inferior (or superior to the MART strategy in reducing exacerbations, (primary outcome), increasing asthma control and quality of life and decrease days lost from work/school or usual activities.

"After a child has their tonsils removed, sometimes they might bleed which can be a problem. There is a special mist medicine called nebulized tranexamic acid (TXA) that might help stop the bleeding without having to touch the sore spot. If this mist works well, it could help kids get better by making sure they don't have to go back for more surgery or need blood from someone else. Not having another surgery is good because it means kids won't have to sleep under medicine again, which can sometimes be risky for their brains and breathing, and they won't feel as scared or hurt.","Hemorrhage, Surgical|Tonsillar Bleeding",ALL,EARLY_PHASE1,"University Hospital, San Antonio, Texas, 78229, United States"
"Women are the fastest-growing group of U.S. Veterans. Over half of those using VA care are 45 or older, with more age-related health concerns than civilian women. The VA urgently needs gender-informed strategies to ensure women Veterans receive tailored care that addresses their intersecting mental, physical, and age related health concerns, as well as gender-linked stressors. One prominent example is menopause, a health transition period that, for many women, can be associated with negative physical and mental health concerns that can worsen their functioning and quality of life. This project will: (1) integrate stakeholder feedback to tailor Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Menopause (CBT-Meno) for women Veterans with menopause concerns; and (2) refine and evaluate tailored CBT-Meno as a treatment to address these intersecting needs in a clinical trial.",Menopause,FEMALE,NA,"Rehabilitation R&D Service, Baltimore, MD, Baltimore, Maryland, 21202, United States|Perry Point VA Medical Center VA Maryland Health Care System, Perry Point, MD, Perry Point, Maryland, 21201-1524, United States"

In this study, the investigators will generate a model for each individual that shows likely causal links between their substance use, urges, and comorbid symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, and PTSD), and the investigators will examine these models as a group to draw conclusions about common causes for substance use (and recovery) among Veterans with substance use disorders. The investigators will also test whether receiving a personal model and clinical feedback improves substance use disorder and comorbid symptom outcomes.

"This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with orbital (eye socket) and/or periorbital (surrounding the eye socket) cutaneous squamous cell cancer (cSCC) that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). Skin cancers that are close to the eye or on the eyelid often have more genetic (heredity) changes than other types of cancers. This means that the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (the building blocks of the body that determine such things as the color of the hair) in tumor tissue has been altered compared to normal tissue. It is thought cancer cells with these DNA changes are more likely to respond to a type of drug called immunotherapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Pembrolizumab is approved for patients with recurrent or metastatic cSCC not amenable (responsive) to cure by surgery or radiation. Giving pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with locally advanced or recurrent orbital and/or periorbital cSCC.",Locally Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck|Recurrent Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck|Stage III Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck AJCC v8,ALL,PHASE2,"University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, United States"
"This clinical trial evaluates \[18F\]-rh PSMA positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) imaging performance in patients with prostate cancer. PET is an established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very minimal amounts of tracer, in the case of this research, 18F-rhPSMA. Because some cancers take up \[18F\]-rhPSMA, cancer cells can be seen with PET. CT utilizes x-rays that traverse body from the outside. CT images provide an exact outline of organs and potential inflammatory tissue where it occurs in patient's body. Posluma (18F-rhPSMA) is an approved prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) imaging agent for prostate cancer. The RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System (RMRS) is designed to facilitate delivery of biology-guided radiotherapy (BgRT). The system uses PET emissions to guide radiotherapy delivery in real-time and has been studied for use with fludeoxyglucose (FDG) (which is an agent used in standard PET-CT scans that targets glucose). Information gathered from this study may help researchers to improve PET-CT imaging on the RefleXion system. This information will be used in the future to improve planning and delivery of radiation therapy that will target (in real time) the signal released from the \[18F\]-rhPSMA PET-CT tracer. Comparing the imaging from the standard of care \[18F\]-rh PSMA PET-CT with the imaging from RMRS may help improve the quality of the imaging captured on the RMRS for detection of imaging signals in patients with prostate cancer.",Prostate Carcinoma,MALE,NA,"City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California, 91010, United States"

"Background:

The purpose of this study is to understand how a type of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), may help those who use opioids such as heroin or methadone. TMS uses brief magnetic pulses to affect brain activity, and is approved by the FDA to treat some mental health problems and substance use. We will evaluate how TMS may help make it easier to make certain kinds of decisions that could help one manage their opioid use. Our findings may provide support for the use of brain stimulation as a treatment to reduce opioid use.

Objective:

To understand how TMS affects brain activity associated with decision making in people who do and do not use opioids.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 to 60 years with an OUD. Healthy volunteers are also needed.

Design:

Participants will have up to 3 clinic visits over 1 to 3 months.

All participants will be screened to check if they are eligible to take part in this study. This study is completed in two parts. All eligible participants will complete the first part of the study. In the first part, you will receive one baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan so we can take pictures of your brain while you complete computer tasks in the scanner. In these tasks, you will be asked to identify colors of words, view different images and play a game in which you can win money. If you can safely receive TMS, you will be invited to complete the second part of the study. In this part of the study, you will receive TMS and MRI over 2 sessions. For TMS, a coil will be placed on your head and a short electrical current will pass through the coil to create a magnetic pulse that stimulates your brain. You will also repeat the MRI scan and computer tasks. During one of the TMS visits you will receive active or real TMS. In the other, you will receive sham or placebo TMS, which feels like real TMS but does not affect the brain. You will receive both types of TMS. In all sessions, your urine and breath will be tested for drugs and alcohol, and you will complete questionnaires about mood and health.",Opioid Use Disorder|Healthy Volunteers,ALL,NA,"National Institute on Drug Abuse, Baltimore, Maryland, 21224, United States"

"Falls are a common occurrence among older adults, and Veterans have an even higher risk of falling compared to non-Veterans. These falls often lead to severe health consequences, including traumatic brain injuries, hip fractures, emergency visits, hospitalizations, and even death. It is crucial to prioritize fall prevention in order to reduce injuries and enable older Veterans to age comfortably at home. Although current fall prevention programs in the Veterans Health Administration primarily focus on inpatient care and nursing homes, there is a pressing need to address falls among older Veterans living independently in the community. The proposed VA-specific Fall Risk Identification and Management (FRIM) model aims to proactively prevent falls in older Veterans who receive primary care, effectively reducing the occurrence of adverse health events associated with falls. By placing emphasis on prevention rather than reacting after falls have already happened, this initiative seeks to significantly enhance the overall well-being of older Veterans.",Fall Risk,ALL,NA,"Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, Aurora, CO, Aurora, Colorado, 80045-7211, United States"
"Attention deficits (AD) frequently co-occur with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The presence of AD is associated with greater PTSD clinical severity and poorer clinical outcomes. Knowledge regarding the mechanism underlying this association is limited, though the emerging evidence has indicated that executive function deficit (EFD) is strongly correlated with AD and PTSD symptoms. While treatments developed for PTSD have existed for years, a substantial portion of individuals do not fully respond to conventional treatment. Accumulating evidence suggest that attention deficit (AD) and EFD may be a driving force for PTSD treatment resistance. However, treatment of executive impairment in PTSD is very limited. As a result, untreated co-occurring AD and EFD in PTSD poses severe negative impacts on patients' functional recovery, treatment outcomes, and quality of life (QoL). Given that up to 50% of patients do not respond well to the first-line pharmacological PTSD treatments, it is imperative to seek novel treatment strategies to improve EF that may improve both standard treatment response and QoL, social function. The proposed study directly addresses this knowledge gap by testing the efficacy of atomoxetine (ATX) in improving EF and attention among Veterans with PTSD, which will further improve Veterans' QoL and social function. ATX represents a promising novel candidate pharmacotherapy for individuals with PTSD. ATX is a non-stimulant selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD. Studies suggest that ATX, unlike stimulants, lacks addictive properties and shows efficacy in the treatment of comorbid depression and anxiety, which is ideal in the treatment of PTSD. Data from the investigators' preliminary study provides encouraging support for the therapeutic potential of ATX in improving EF in Veterans with comorbid PTSD/ADHD. The investigators' recent research uncovered a higher rate of ADHD among Veterans with PTSD, and the comorbid AD symptoms were correlated with PTSD severity and poorer treatment outcomes. Treatment with ATX showed significant symptoms reduction in ADHD and improvement in inhibitory function in Veterans with ADHD/PTSD. In the proposed study, the investigators will focus on ATX in improvement of EF and attention, and further psycho-social life function and QoL. The investigators will (1) employ a randomized, double-blind design that will consist of 12 weeks of treatment with ATX or placebo medication; (2) use standardized, repeated dependent measures to rigorously assess AD and EFD symptomatology; (3) measure impairment in associated mental and behavioral health problems (e.g., attention deficit, depression, anxiety, suicidality, QoL, family/social functioning); and (4) use response inhibition task GoNogo, working memory and attention tests Digit Span and Trail Making to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of PTSD and prognostic indicators of treatment outcome. To achieve these goals, the investigators have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in PTSD, ADHD clinical trials, and human laboratory paradigms who have successfully collaborated in the past and are uniquely qualified to implement this type of investigation. The proposed project is directly responsive to the mission of the VA-RRD ""to maximize Veterans' functional independence, quality of life and participation in their lives and community."" Successful completion of this study will provide a platform for a large multi-center trial to further confirm the important role of EF in PTSD treatment outcomes. The findings from this study will provide critically needed evidence to help inform clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of PTSD. The outcome of the proposed research will be significant, because it provides a knowledge base to allow for development of new PTSD intervention strategies. More importantly, this clinical trial may immediately benefit Veterans by enhancing their cognitive function, reducing AD related disability, and further improving quality of life for Veterans who suffer from PTSD.",Posttraumatic Stress Disorder With Attention Defic,ALL,PHASE4,"Ralph H.

"In Canada, about 900 babies each year are born very early (\<26 weeks of gestation) and have a high chance of dying or having a serious bleed in the brain. Families of these extremely preterm babies consider preventing severe brain bleeding as critical to their child's health and well-being. A medicine called indomethacin, when given intravenously in 3-doses, is known to reduce severe brain bleeding. But use of this drug is variable among clinicians working in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to (a) its side effects on the gut; (b) possible harm when used with other medications; (c) a notion that despite reducing brain bleeds, the child's long-term brain development is not improved. Emerging evidence suggests that a single low-dose indomethacin regimen may be equally effective in reducing severe brain bleeding as compared to a traditional 3-dose regimen.

The investigators propose a blinded randomized controlled trial, a study design where babies born \<26 weeks will be randomly assigned within 12 hours of birth to either a single dose of intravenous indomethacin or similar looking placebo in the form a saline solution. The study will test if a single dose indomethacin regimen is effective in improving survival of these babies without the devastating complication of severe brain bleeding. In this study the care providers and researchers will be unaware as to which baby receives indomethacin and which baby receives placebo to ensure no one's expectations or biases can influence the results.

The investigators will conduct the study in multiple NICUs across Canada, the United States and Australia and will enroll 500 babies born \<26 weeks or \<750 g birth weight over a period of 3 years. This study will help the investigators determine in the most unbiased way whether a single dose of indomethacin given immediately after birth in the smallest babies born \<26 weeks of gestation can safely and effectively reduce severe brain bleeding.",Extreme Prematurity|Intraventricular Hemorrhage|Morbidity;Newborn,ALL,PHASE3,"Kaiser Roseville, Roseville, California, 95661, United States|UC Davis Health, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15224-1334, United States|Monash Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia|The Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia|Foothills Medical Center, Calgary, Alberta, Canada|Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada|Royal Columbian Hospital, New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada|BC Women's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6H 3N1, Canada|IWK Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada|Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada|Montreal Children's Hospital, MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada|CHU de Quebec, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada"
"This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of NEXI-001 when given with decitabine and lymphodepleting chemotherapy in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory) following an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from a matched donor. NEXI-001 is a type of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy, with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps prepare the body for the new CAR-T cells. Giving NEXI-001 with decitabine and lymphodepleting chemotherapy may be safe and tolerable in treating patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS following an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from a matched donor.",Recurrent Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Recurrent Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome,ALL,PHASE1,"City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California, 91010, United States"

"This phase I/II trial tests the safety and effectiveness of extramedullary disease (EMD)-directed external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in combination with talquetamab for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients with extramedullary disease. Extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma involves the infiltration of organs and soft tissues by malignant plasma cells and has proven difficult to treat. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells and shrink cancers. EBRT is a type of radiation therapy that delivers high-energy beams to the cancer from outside of the body. In this trial, the EBRT will be directed to a site of extramedullary disease. Talquetamab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens).

The main barriers to using statins are patients' perceived lack of benefit, excess risk of statin toxicity as well as their misperceptions of their CVD risk. Statin pharmacogenomic testing - an application of precision medicine - is a readily available, feasible, and inexpensive intervention that addresses this barrier by using genetic testing to identify the nearly 1 out of 2 patients with enhanced benefit and/or reduced risk of statin toxicity or increased risk for CVD.

"Improving multiple domains of cardiometabolic health (CMH) through contextual behavioral interventions has the potential to substantially reduce persistent chronic disease disparities. Sleep is critical for preserving CMH and is amenable to intervention in real-world settings. Although sleep health, in conjunction with other lifestyle behaviors, can improve CMH through complementary or synergistic pathways, most existing lifestyle change programs focus solely on diet and physical activity. Sleep2BWell is a community-based cluster randomized trial aimed at evaluating the impact of incorporating a multidimensional sleep health intervention into the BWell4Life program, an ongoing 4-week program for promoting CMH through healthy diet and physical activity, delivered by peer health educators at faith-based organizations and community centers in underserved NYC neighborhoods. The enhanced 6-week intervention, Sleep2BWell, will include the following additional components: 1) two sleep health education and group coaching sessions, 2) self-monitoring and motivational enhancement using a Fitbit, and 3) addressing prevalent environmental barriers to healthy sleep in urban settings such as noise and light with a novel and timely extension to address indoor air pollution. A total of 14 community sites will be randomized into the intervention (Sleep2BWell) or control (BWell4Life) group, enrolling an average of 15 participants per site for an expected sample of 210. The investigators will collect objective measures of sleep and physical activity throughout the study, and assess diet and CMH outcomes at baseline, 10 weeks (primary endpoint), and 24 weeks (long-term follow-up to assess sustainability of the intervention's effect). The investigators hypothesize that Sleep2BWell will enhance the effectiveness of BWell4Life leading to greater improvements in CMH, including reduced blood pressure (primary outcome) improved health behaviors (sleep, diet, physical activity) and adiposity markers (secondary outcomes), as well as better glycemic control and inflammatory and allostatic load indicators (exploratory outcomes).

"Lay Summary

This study tests two ways of measuring blood magnesium after heart surgery. Children who need heart surgery may have heart and kidney problems after surgery. The right amount of magnesium in blood reduces this risk. This study will test the best way to measure magnesium. This will let doctors choose the right dose of MgSO4. MgSO4 is a magnesium supplement. Taking MgSO4 after heart surgery helps children. For each child, it is best to personalize MgSO4 dose. This is based on the amount of magnesium in blood. This study will test two ways of personalizing MgSO4 dose.

In the blood, there are two kinds of magnesium. Usually, blood magnesium tests measure both forms together. This does not say anything about active magnesium. This study will measure the two forms separately. Then, MgSO4 will be given based on either the active or whole magnesium. Measuring active magnesium is good. Active magnesium levels change faster than total. That means active magnesium tests may better protect children. Also, active magnesium has more of an impact on heart and kidney function. Focusing on the active form will help these organs stay healthy.

To test how well the MgSO4 is working, heart and kidneys will be examined. After surgery, certain harmful heart rhythms can occur. The types and number of harmful rhythms will be studied. Kidney problems can also happen after heart surgery. Kidney health will be studied. To help understand how active magnesium works, further tests will be done. These tests will look for evidence of poor health in the cells that make up the heart, kidney, and blood.",AKI - Acute Kidney Injury|Arrythmia|Congenital Heart Disease,ALL,NA,"West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, 26506, United States"

"Although over 75% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are born in sub-Sahara where the disease highly contributes to under-5 mortality and causes life-long debilitation, evidence-based strategies to control SCD are not widely implemented in this region. Early detection of SCD by universal infant screening is a pillar of SCD control. Despite the affordability and move to adopt point-of-care (POC) SCD screening assays in sub-Sahara Africa, the absence of screening information management and communication systems (SIMCS) impedes standardized, systematic, coordinated, nationwide SCD screening programs. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a SCD SIMCS that will enable universal SCD screening in the sub-Sahara African setting. The objective is to test and optimize a custom SCD SIMCS app and digital network to facilitate SCD screening and then evaluate its impact on access to SCD screening and care and on clinical outcomes of children with SCD in Uganda. The central hypothesis is that the SCD SIMCS will facilitate accurate and coordinated POC SCD screening that is accessible at health centers in urban and rural Uganda. The rationale is to build a custom SCD SIMCS on existing nationwide digital and health infrastructure in Uganda to standardize use of affordable POC assays at health centers nationwide. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a four-module â¥3G cell phone app for a novel SCD SIMCS (R21 Phase); 2) Evaluate the impact of the SCD SIMCS on access to screening and care and outcomes of children with SCD (R33 Phase). The investigators will pursue these aims using an innovative combination of software design and re-organization of SCD screening workflows. These include assembly of off-the-shelf software that is compatible with iOS and Android operating systems to reliably, accurately, and handily capture, interpret, transmit, and retrieve/playback information for patient's IDs, test results, salient clinical events, and education. The novel screening workflows are expected to dramatically reduce the cost and increase access to SCD screening and care. The proposed research is significant, because it will determine how to use POC SCD screening assays on a large nationwide scale. It will also enable coordination of evidence-based care and continuity of care between primary and specialist providers and longitudinally over the patient's lifetime - a critical aspect in controlling this life-long disease. The SCD SIMCS will also facilitate real time data management for research and policy for SCD control. The expected immediate outcome of this research is a SCD SIMCS that optimally functions on the digital and health infrastructure in Uganda and demonstration of its impact on access to SCD screening and care and on clinical outcomes of children with SCD. The expected long-term outcome is that the SCD SIMCS will be adopted, integrated, and scaled-up in the health systems of Uganda and other sub-Sahara Africa countries, particularly those where the POC assays have already been adopted as the national standard of SCD screening. If effective, the SCD SIMCS will have an important positive impact because it will reduce the cost of SCD screening, take screening services and evidence-based care closer to rural communities where the majority of children in sub-Sahara Africa live, and, ultimately, save millions of children from preventable and disability death.",Sickle Cell Disease,ALL,NA,"Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, 256, Uganda"

"Background:

People with substance use disorder (SUD) often have changes in brain function that can make it difficult to control drug-seeking behavior. These changes may heighten the urge to use drugs or lessen the desire to seek nondrug-related rewards. Researchers want to know how a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may cause changes in brain activity that may help people with SUD.

Objective:

To test TMS in healthy volunteers.

Eligibility:

Healthy people aged 18 to 45 years who are right-handed.

Design:

Participants can volunteer for up to 5 different experiments. Each experiment requires 2 to 8 clinic visits. Each visit will last 3 to 7 hours.

Some visits will include TMS. A coil will be placed on the participant s head. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil to create a magnetic field. Participants may feel a tapping or pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. They may feel a twitch in their face, neck, arm, or leg muscles. Participants may be asked to tense certain muscles during TMS.

Some visits will include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. Participants will lie on a bed that slides into a large tube. They will perform tasks on a computer inside the tube. The fMRI will show which parts of the brain are used during each task.

Participants will perform tasks on a computer. Some tasks may be done at a desk as well as during TMS and fMRI. Participants may look at images, listen to sounds, smell odors, or taste flavored liquids. Their vital signs may be monitored and their eye movements may be tracked during tasks.",Normal Physiology,ALL,EARLY_PHASE1,"National Institute on Drug Abuse, Baltimore, Maryland, 21224, United States"
"Hoarding disorder (HD) is characterized by difficulty discarding personal possessions due to significant emotional distress when parting with personal items. This leads to the accumulation of excessive clutter which compromises the normal use of living spaces. In addition to emotional distress, individuals with HD experience significant impairment in physical health. One study found an 11-fold increase in stroke risk, a 10-fold increase in cancer risk, and a 7-fold increase in cardiovascular disease in individuals with HD relative to a general population comparison group. Patients with HD are also more likely to experience obesity and metabolic diseases such as diabetes. The short-term goal of the proposed study is to determine whether a brief exercise intervention improves discarding-related distress and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in individuals with HD relative to a relaxation control condition. Preliminary evidence suggests that BDNF may be associated with greater body mass index and more severe HD symptoms in patients with HD. BDNF is a well-studied growth factor which is involved in neuronal transmission, plasticity, and survival of many neuron systems that have been implicated in psychiatric disorders, including serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine. BDNF has been proposed as a mechanism of exercise interventions for psychiatric disorders, as even one session of exercise has been shown to increase BDNF levels. This study represents an initial first step towards the long-term goal of improving current treatments for HD. This is important because although current cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) are effective, only 35% of patients who receive these treatments actually benefit from them. In the proposed pilot study, the investigators will test whether 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise reduces the distress associated with discarding and increases BDNF levels in individuals with HD relative to a relaxation control. The investigators will recruit 22 individuals with a primary diagnosis of HD. They will be randomly assigned to exercise or control. Following the intervention, the investigators will assess BDNF via serum. Participants will complete a standardized discarding task which consists of sorting and discarding personal possessions. The central hypothesis is that those in the exercise condition will demonstrate lower distress during the discarding task and greater BDNF levels as compared to those in the relaxation control condition. Should the hypothesis be confirmed, the investigators will be well poised to conduct large-scale clinical trials testing exercise interventions as adjunctive or alternative treatments to standard CBT.",Hoarding Disorder,ALL,NA,"Anxiety Disorders Center, Institute of Living, Hartford, Connecticut, 06106, United States"

"People with HIV experience earlier impairments in physical function compared to people in the general population. They also exhibit an earlier presentation and more rapid development of frailty, a multisystemic syndrome of aging characterized by reduced activity, fatigue, slowness, weakness, and weight loss. While exercise can improve physical function in people with HIV, it is less effective in doing so than in the general population and is difficult to sustain in the long-term.

The goal of this clinical trial is to learn whether the medication tesamorelin will improve physical function and muscle health in adults with HIV when combined with exercise. Tesamorelin is a growth hormone-releasing hormone analogue that is FDA-approved to treat abdominal fat accumulation in people with HIV. While tesamorelin has also been shown to increase muscle mass and improve measures of muscle health, its effects on physical performance and muscle strength have not yet been evaluated.

During a 24-week intervention phase, half of participants will be randomly assigned to receive tesamorelin and half of participants will be randomly assigned to receive placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug). All participants also will engage in a home-based exercise intervention supervised by an exercise coach. During a subsequent 24-week extension phase, individuals will be monitored off study drug and supervised exercise, and be encouraged to continue to exercise independently.

The investigators will investigate effects of tesamorelin on physical function, muscle mass and quality, quality of life, and exercise adherence and self-efficacy.

"Pancreatic necrosis is a serious complication of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic necrosis involves the irreversible death of pancreatic tissue, which can lead to severe health issues, including infections and an increased risk of death. An endoscopic procedure called direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) is typically performed to remove this necrotic pancreatic tissue as a minimally invasive treatment. This procedure is performed using a thin, flexible, lighted tube called an endoscope and endoscopic instruments that are used with working channels through the scope. Current methods for removing necrotic tissue involve using endoscopic devices such as snares, baskets, nets, and forceps. However, these standard methods are often not very effective because the necrotic tissue can be sticky and hard to grasp. This DEN procedure is part of regular clinical care to treat this condition and remove necrotic tissue from the pancreas.

For this research study, the same DEN procedure will be followed with the exception of the device used for the removal of the necrotic tissue. Instead of using forceps, snares, or other traditional tools, a cryoprobe will be used. Cryoprobes work by using extremely cold temperatures to freeze and adhere to the necrotic tissue, making it easier to remove. This method might be better because it can secure larger tissue samples and potentially reduce complications associated with traditional methods. Cryotechnology is successfully used in endoscopy to remove necrotic tissue, foreign bodies and more, but has not been extensively tested in pancreatic necrosis. Cryoprobes are FDA approved medical devices with an established safety record. They are used successfully in very sensitive areas such as the lungs.

"Background:

People use virtual reality (VR) technology to play games, socialize, work, or receive medical care. Some people have ""cybersickness"" after using VR. Cybersickness is similar to motion sickness. Symptoms include eye strain, nausea, dizziness, or headache. The symptoms are usually mild and go away after the person stops using VR. New software called Motion Reset is being designed to reduce symptoms of cybersickness during VR use.

Objective:

To see if Motion Reset software can reduce cybersickness in people using VR.

Eligibility:

Healthy adults aged 18 to 60 years.

Design:

Participants will have 1 clinic visit that will last about 1 hour. They will answer questions about how they are feeling. They will learn how to use the VR headset and the handheld game controllers.

The study will be broken into 2 parts. For the first part, participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups:

Group 1 will participate in a VR experience designed to prevent cybersickness. They will view screens and move around while they press buttons on a controller.

Group 2 will participate in a VR experience that is not designed to prevent cybersickness. They will view screens and move around while they press buttons on a controller.

Group 3 will have no VR experience.

Participants will complete 2 questionnaires about their experiences in the first part of the study.

For the second part, all participants will spend up to 20 minutes playing a commercial VR game called Jurassic World Aftermath. Every few minutes, they will be asked if they are experiencing discomfort.

"There are a variety of techniques utilized to close lacerations, including but not limited to, traditional sutures, staples, adhesive strips, and skin glue. While closing open wounds and preventing infection are the primary goals of laceration repair, physicians are also concerned with minimizing scar formation and providing the best cosmetic outcomes for the patient. Specifically, the skin on the face is a sensitive area where cosmetic outcome is of high importance, and several laceration repair techniques have been devised for closing facial wounds.

Sutures have traditionally been used to close wounds in various types of tissue, and it is still very commonly used in the clinical setting. Adhesive strips (also known under the brand names of Steri-Strips, Curi-strips, Nichi-Strips, and Suture Strips) are another method to repair lacerations superficially. Due to their superficial application and ease of use, adhesive strips may help minimize scar formation and may result in less pain and complications for the patient when compared to conventional sutures.

"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays a key role in regulating epidermal cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Keratins form a scaffold with epidermal desmosomes that involves ErbB/ EGFR signaling and keratin deficiency makes keratinocytes more sensitive to EGFR activation. Erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, was approved 20 years ago for cancer treatment and is generally used at 150 mg daily in adults \>50 kg. While gastrointestinal and cutaneous side effects commonly occur at doses of 150 mg, adverse events occur less often at lower doses. We first reported erlotinib as effective for Olmsted syndrome, a rare hereditary EDD with painful PPK that results from variants in TRPV3. Erlotinib is now the treatment of choice for children and adults with Olmsted syndrome. Erlotinib is thought to inhibit formation of a complex that includes TRPV3, EGFR, and its primary skin-based ligand, TGF-a, which in turn regulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. High-throughput screening to identify compounds that stabilize keratin filaments have also pointed to the EGFR pathway for targeting. Reviews and recent case reports have suggested the benefit of erlotinib for PC,

Given these preliminary data, we hypothesize that EGFR activation is a characteristic feature of keratinopathies. Further, we expect that oral low-dose erlotinib will improve the scaling and skin thickening of the spectrum of keratinopathies and be tolerated by most patients. For those who experience pain, particularly from plantar involvement, we predict that erlotinib therapy will improve mobility and pain. Finally, we aim to find the mechanism by which erlotinib improves the phenotypes of the various keratinopathies to better understand these disorders and predict response. We will look specifically at the impact on differentiation vs. hyperproliferation and barrier function, as well as the immune modulatory effects of the erlotinib using a multi-omics approach.",Epidermolytic Ichthyosis|Palmoplantar Keratoderma|Pachyonychia Congenita,ALL,PHASE1|PHASE2,"Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States"

"This phase I/II trial tests the safety and effectiveness of receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy along with chemotherapy, consisting of cisplatin and paclitaxel, and immunotherapy, consisting of bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with stage IVB cervical cancer. EBRT is type of radiation therapy that uses a machine to aim high-energy rays at the cancer from outside of the body. Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. A monoclonal antibody, such as pembrolizumab, is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Giving EBRT and brachytherapy along with chemotherapy and immunotherapy may be a safe and effective way to treat patients with stage IVB cervical cancer.",Cervical Adenocarcinoma|Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma|Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Stage IVB Cervical Cancer American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) v8,ALL,PHASE1|PHASE2,"UCLA / Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|University of California San Diego (UCSD), San Diego, California, 96960, United States|University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73104, United States|University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, Virginia, 22908, United States"

"The objective of the study is to investigate the treatment of marginal ulcers with Low Thermal plasma in an endoscopic setting. By a treatment of the ulcerated areas with argon plasma with low power settings (\~ 1 W) we hypothesize that the size of the ulcers will shrink, and the healing is accelerated compared to standard of care alone. Patients will benefit from this minimally invasive approach compared to a much more invasive surgical approach that comes with higher risks and hospital stay length time. From a societal and scientific perspective, this study aims to extend the well-documented clinical benefits of plasma technology - from external wound healing to internal ulcer treatment - within an endoscopic framework. The success of this study could pave the way for broader applications of LTP in the treatment of other endoscopically accessible conditions such as peptic ulcers, duodenal ulcers and esophageal ulcers. This advancement has the potential not only to improve patient outcomes through less invasive methods, but also to position LTP as a cornerstone in the future of gastroenterological wound management strategies.","Roux-en-y Anastomosis Site|Marginal Ulcer|Marginal Ulcer (Peptic) or Erosion|Ulcer|Ulcer, Gastric|Ulcer Gastrointestinal|Abdominal Pain|Nausea|Vomiting|GastroIntestinal Bleeding|Dysphagia|Ulcer Gastrojejunal",ALL,NA,"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States"

"This study is a randomized, single-blind, two-arm sham-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) over the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord segments for cardiovascular function in adults (21-65 years old) with cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) (â¥T6) AIS A-D during inpatient rehabilitation and outpatient visits within three months after the onset. We will recruit 26 individuals with SCI, admitted to inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) or after discharged from IRFs. We will also examine the effect of tSCS on lower urinary tract (LUT) and bowel functions as secondary outcomes.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

1. Assess the safety of single and repeated tSCS session(s) on cardiovascular function in the acute SCI: We will test the safety of single tSCS at T10-L2 session at rest and during orthostatic challenge (i.e., situ-up tests) at the baseline and the effect of five tSCS sessions on cardiovascular function in individuals with SCI â¥ T6.
2. Assess the effect of long-term tSCS on autonomic function in the subacute SCI phase: We will investigate the efficacy of long-term (total 18 sessions) tSCS on cardiovascular and pelvic organ functions.
3. Evaluate the sustained effect of tSCS on autonomic recovery six months after the onset of SCI: We will assess the sustained effect of repeated tSCS sessions (18 sessions) on cardiovascular and pelvic organ functions at 6-month post-SCI.

Participants will:

* Receive either transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation or ""sham"" spinal cord stimulation while inpatient in the first 8 weeks (Part A).

"This phase Ib/II trial evaluates the safety, optimal dose, and efficacy of the combination of epcoritamab and ibrutinib in treating patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or responded to previous treatment (refractory). Epcoritamab, a bispecific antibody, binds to two different types of receptors (proteins present on the cell surface) at the same time. The two receptors that epcoritamab binds to are called CD3 and CD20. CD3 is found on T cells, which are important cells of the immune system that help fight cancer and infections. CD20 is found on the surface of most types of aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells. By binding to both CD3 and CD20, epcoritamab brings the two cells close together so the T cells can fight and kill the lymphoma B cells. Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, binds to a protein on B cells, a type of white blood cell from which the lymphoma developed. By doing this it decreases the ability of the lymphoma B cells to survive and grow. Ibrutinib may also improve the health (or fitness) of T cells thus making epcoritamab safer and/or more effective.","Recurrent Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Grade 3b Follicular Lymphoma|Recurrent High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma With MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 Rearrangements|Recurrent High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma With MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 Rearrangements|Recurrent High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified|Recurrent Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Transformed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Refractory Grade 3b Follicular Lymphoma|Refractory High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma With MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 Rearrangements|Refractory High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma With MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 Rearrangements|Refractory High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified|Refractory Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Refractory Transformed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma",ALL,PHASE1|PHASE2,"University of Minnesota/Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States"

Participants will not have a plan to quit smoking and will not be actively trying to quit smoking at the start of the trial. The main questions the study aims to answer are:

* Are e-cigarettes a feasible and acceptable harm-reduction tool among older adults who currently smoke tobacco and don\&#39;t have a plan to quit?
* Will switching to e-cigarettes and reducing tobacco use be more likely among patients given access to e-cigarettes compared to individuals who are exposed to a standard brief intervention for smoking cessation (control)?
* Does the accuracy of nicotine/tobacco knowledge change after participants are exposed to education on the harms of nicotine relative to no education?

Participants will complete a baseline session (BL) and follow-up visits at weeks 2, 6, and 8, each lasting 30-90 minutes, for a total of approximately 3-4 hours of participation in the study.

This clinical trial evaluates if in-person acupuncture or virtual acupressure therapy prevents aromatase inhibitor-associated joint pain in Non-Hispanic Black postmenopausal women with stage I-III (early-stage) hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are medications that prevent the formation of the hormone estrogen. They are used in the treatment of postmenopausal women who have hormone-dependent breast cancer. AI therapy prolongs life among patients with early-stage HR+ breast cancer. Many postmenopausal women stop AI therapy early due to debilitating joint pain (arthralgias). Non-Hispanic Black women are more likely to experience side effects and stop their hormonal therapy compared to Non-Hispanic white women. Acupuncture therapy involves inserting thin needles through the skin at specific points on the body to control pain. Acupressure therapy uses the application of pressure or localized massage to specific sites on the body to control symptoms such as pain. Acupuncture and acupressure are types of complementary and alternative medicine. Undergoing in-person acupuncture or participating in virtual acupressure may prevent AI-associated arthralgias (AIAA) in Non-Hispanic Black postmenopausal women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer.,Anatomic Stage I Breast Cancer AJCC V8|Anatomic Stage II Breast Cancer AJCC V8|Anatomic Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC V8|HER2-Negative Breast Carcinoma|Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Carcinoma,FEMALE,NA,"Grady Health System, Atlanta, Georgia, 30303, United States|Emory University Hospital Midtown, Atlanta, Georgia, 30308, United States|Emory University Hospital/Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, 30342, United States"

"The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of an argon plasma-based therapy - HEAPE - in treating H. pylori infections during endoscopic procedures. By filling the stomach with sodium chloride solution that is treated with APC (PAL), the Investigators hypothesize a significant reduction in H. pylori. The use of PAL instead of direct application of APC allows for a broader and more homogeneous application throughout the stomach and a faster procedure time, as the fluid bypasses the thermal effects typically associated with higher electrical power settings and focuses on the bactericidal action of PAL. It is a procedure that does not involve thermal ablation of the stomach lining. Thus, side effects should be expected to be as low as possible.

Two different PAL generation modalities will be compared in this study:

1. HEAPE direct: This modality is the direct generation of PAL in the stomach. The stomach is filled with sodium chloride solution which is then treated with APC. With HEAPE direct a potential decrease of reactive species is avoided, as the treatment happens directly at the intended location in the H. pylori infected stomach.
2. Pre-HEAPE: This modality features the treatment of sodium chloride with APC outside of the patient in a sterile container. After the APC treatment, the generated PAL is administered into the stomach with a syringe through the working channel of the endoscope. Pre-HEAPE allows an easier handling of the APC probe as the treatment of the sodium chloride solution can be done without an endoscope.

To evaluate the immediate effect of this novel treatment approach the metabolic activity of H. pylori will be assessed using a urea breath test (UBT) before and after treatment. A reduction in H. pylori levels can be detected by a reduction in urease activity in the breath test.

After the HEAPE procedure, patients are treated with antibiotics (best practice) as they would be under normal circumstances. Four weeks after treatment, another UBT is performed to determine if H. pylori has been eradicated or if additional antibiotic treatment is indicated.

This two-arm, randomized, pilot, single-center, prospective clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and proof of concept that PAL has the ability to eradicate or reduce the bacterial load of H. pylori in humans.",Helicobacter Pylori Infection|Helicobacter Pylori|Helicobacter Pylori Gastrointestinal Tract Infection|H.

"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a permanent condition affecting every aspect of life including health, daily activities, and participation and quality of life. Persons with SCI are at high risk of pressure injury (PrI) throughout their lives due to loss of sensation, nerve damage and immobility. PrIs are local areas of damage to the skin and underlying soft tissue caused by pressure and shear commonly located over bony prominences. While most PrIs are hospital- or nursing home-acquired, in people with SCI, PrIs typically develop in the community. Community-acquired pressure injuries (CAPrIs) are common, devastating, and costly. This grant proposal will assess how well a decision support tool, called the Community Acquired Pressure Injury Prevention Field Implementation Tool (CAPP-FIT), is used in the clinic and how well it prevents CAPrIs. The CAPP-FIT will be implemented at seven sites across the country in a staggered fashion. The CAPP-FIT includes: 1) an automated Veteran survey to identify risks, actions, and resources needed to prevent CAPrIs and 2) a companion Provider Report immediately available in the electronic health record listing Veteran responses to survey items with recommended evidence-based provider actions. The Veteran survey can be completed via a secured email on the computer or phone. There are three aims in the proposal: Aim 1 is implementing the CAPP-FIT at the seven geographically diverse VA SCI clinics.

Bicalutamide is in a class of medications called androgen receptor inhibitors. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male reproductive hormone) to stop the growth and spread of tumor cells. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists prevent the body from making luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This causes the testicles to stop making testosterone (a male hormone) in men and may stop the growth of prostate cancer cells that need testosterone to grow.

"Over half of cancer patients receiving common chemotherapy treatments experience painful nerve damage called chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients are more likely to suffer from this condition and more often need to reduce their chemotherapy doses compared to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients.

Currently, only one medication, duloxetine, is approved for treating CIPN, but it doesn't work for everyone. A new approach, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), shows promise as a safe and effective treatment. tDCS can be done at home and reduces the need for hospital visits.

Research indicates that tDCS can improve pain responses in the brain's pain control network. There are differences in pain sensitivity and brain activity related to pain between NHB and NHW individuals, which may influence the effectiveness of treatments.

This research aims to conduct a study to:

1. Test if tDCS is a helpful treatment for painful CIPN.
2. Investigate how CIPN affects brain function in NHB and NHW patients.
3. Examine the role of inflammation in CIPN and its connection to pain severity and brain function.

The investigators expect that NHB patients will benefit more from tDCS due to differences in their brain's pain response system.

"The bidirectional effects between psychological distress and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity mean that not only does increased IBD activity trigger psychological distress, but psychological distress triggers increased IBD activity (i.e., gut-brain interaction). Comorbid psychological distress is linked to increased health resource utilization and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This has prompted calls for integrating psychological care into IBD practice with restoration of quality of life as a clinical target of IBD management alongside endoscopic healing. The IBD Social Cognitive Model (IBD SCM) posits that patient psycho-behavioral modifiers contribute to IBD outcomes and not disease modifiers alone. While a co-localized gastro-psychologist in an IBD medical home is an emerging mode of delivering psycho-behavioral care among people living with IBD, access and scalability of this form of support is not yet widespread, particularly in resource-limited settings. Though many people with IBD have significant psychological distress, mental health care is underutilized with cost cited as a barrier.

The emergence of digital interventions in clinical practice presents an opportunity to address access, scalability, and cost barriers. However, current testing of digital interventions to address gut-brain interactions (digital mind-body intervention, DMBI) among people with IBD involves mostly women with high educational attainment who have full time employment and do not receive social service benefits. Individuals with limited resources and those from racial and ethnic minority groups (e.g. Black, Hispanic) often have socioecological factors, such as healthcare access and mental health stigma, that impede their use of psycho-behavioral resources. DMBI development informed by participatory research approaches are, therefore, critical to facilitate equitable engagement and utilization. Beneficial effects of psycho-behavioral treatment among people with IBD are strongest for those who have psychological distress and for acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based approaches.

Although high quality evidence demonstrates psychological improvement with DMBI in IBD, feasibility and acceptability of applying DMBI to IBD patients from racial and ethnic minority groups is lacking.",Crohn's Disease|Ulcerative Colitis|Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,ALL,NA,"Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, 10467, United States"

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that causes tumors to grow along the nerves in the skin, brain, and other parts of the body. People with NF1 often have pain and may experience other abnormal sensations like itching, numbness, or tingling. These symptoms can affect their daily life. Researchers want to learn more about these symptoms and find better ways to measure pain in people with NF1.

Objective:

To learn if a device called the AlgometRx Nociometer is effective in measuring pain or other abnormal sensations in people with NF1.

Eligibility:

People aged 1 year and older with NF1.

Design:

Participants can have up to 3 assessments completed in person. Each assessment may last up to 1.0 to 1.5 hours.

Participants will be screened. They will complete questionnaires about their health and how bad their pain is. If participants are having blood drawn for other reasons, some additional samples may be used in this study.

The AlgometRx Nociometer includes an electrode that will be placed onto a finger or a toe. The electrode will send non-painful electrical signals to activate nerves in the finger or toe. At the same time, a camera will be used to record changes in the pupil of the eye. The test will be done on all 4 of the participant s limbs; however, researchers may skip 1 or more limbs for various reasons. This test takes about 10 seconds to complete with at least a one-minute rest between testing different limbs.

"Background:

Fibroblast-activation protein (FAP) is an enzyme that appears in high numbers in certain cancer cells. \[18F\]FAPI-74 is a new tracer-a substance that is injected into a person s body before an imaging scan. Researchers believe that \[18F\]FAPI-74 may be able to highlight FAP enzymes more effectively than approved tracers.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years or older with cancer in 1 of these places: the ducts of the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, or small intestine; stomach; bladder; ovaries; or adrenal glands. They must be enrolled in an NIH treatment study for their cancer.

Design:

Participants will have 2 baseline scans: 1 with \[18F\]FAPI-74; 1 with an approved tracer.

Although age of the patients will be restricted to those who are at least 50 years old and caregivers must be adults over 18 and all participants must speak English, the study will enroll all sexes, genders, races, and ethnicities. The main questions the study aims to answer are:

1. Compared to usual care, does PIC-TRFS improve patient quality of life at the end of the 6-month intervention period measured via PROMIS-Preferences (PROPr) score?
2. Compared to usual care, does PIC-TRFS improve patient physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning measured via PROMIS Physical, Cognitive, and Depression Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) at 6 and 12 months after discharge? Does it increase the number of days survivors spend alive at home in the 6 and 12 months after discharge? Does it improve patient and family trauma scores and dyadic quality of life, measured via the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and dyadic PROPr score?

Participants will:

* Complete Run-In assessments of symptoms and function in the hospital;
* Be randomized to intervention or control;
* Complete assessments of their function and quality of life at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months
* Control participants will get a brochure on the Post-Intensive Care syndrome and complete the assessments on the same schedule as those receiving the intervention
* Intervention participants will complete tele-health based check-ins providing health management, social support, and care coordination; and telehealth-based rehabilitation sessions focusing on patient functioning.",Intensive Care Unit Syndrome|Disabilities Multiple|Critical Illness|Caregiver Burden,ALL,NA,"UPMC/University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States"

"Hearing aids can improve hearing, communication, and overall quality of life for people with hearing loss. However, not many people use hearing aids. A common reason is that hearing aids are expensive and hard to get. The traditional way to get hearing aids involves multiple visits to licensed audiologists for identifying hearing loss, customizing the aids, and ongoing maintenance. This traditional method is called the AUD pathway.

Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids offer a different approach. They aim to make hearing aids more affordable and accessible, encouraging earlier use. In the OTC pathway, users diagnose their own hearing loss and fit and program the hearing aids themselves. Little is known about long-term effects of OTC hearing aids on users.

This study aims to compare the experiences of people who choose the OTC pathway with those who choose the AUD pathway. It takes place in two locations: Iowa City, IA, and Nashville, TN. Participants, who have mild-to-moderate hearing loss, choose their preferred pathway and are followed for 12 months. In the OTC pathway, participants buy their hearing aids directly from OTC companies or retailers. In the AUD pathway, prescription hearing aids and fitting services are provided by audiology clinics at the University of Iowa and Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Participants are contacted 1, 6, and 12 months after starting to use their hearing aids. Researchers measure their satisfaction about hearing aids and other outcomes. If participants stop using their hearing aids, researchers assess their engagement with post-amplification hearing care. The results from both pathways are then compared.","Hearing Loss, Sensorineural|Presbycusis",ALL,NA,"University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, United States|Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States"

"Children with ""bothersome"" tinnitus and misophonia have elevated anxiety and depression symptoms. The mainstay therapy for adults and children with these disorders is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT resources are expensive and scarce for the pediatric population. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) has been shown in the adult population to be a proxy for CBT for several mental health disorders. There is sufficient published evidence that IVR is useful in treating adults with anxiety and depression disorders. However, the evidence in children in treating either anxiety and depression symptoms or disorder is scant.

"Children of mothers with substance use disorder (SUD) constitute a growing and highly vulnerable population. Evidence-based parenting interventions have the potential to both support parents' recovery and mental health by helping them cope with stress of parenthood and promote the optimal development of their children by supporting responsive parenting. The Supporting Our Families through Addiction and Recovery (SOFAR) pediatric medical home for families and children impacted by SUDs, with integrated behavioral health (IBH), provides an opportune setting for addressing the needs of mothers and children impacted by SUDs. While many families are thriving in the program, there is a strong unmet need for evidence-based parent-training interventions, particularly during the preschool period.

The research design is a randomized clinical trial with factorial design

This randomized clinical trial of 254 patients using a factorial design will leverage a clinical trial platform developed through the University of Pennsylvania that allows for the remotely capture important patient-reported outcomes and other interaction through a participant's smart phone. The investigators will randomize participants to receive social incentives with gamification to promote adherence to prescribed exercises as well as maintenance of greater levels of physical activity and compare to controls that receive a Fitbit but no additional incentive. Participants may also be randomized to receive a health coach. The investigators will utilize mobile applications for smart phones and wearable activity trackers through the Way-to-Health platform and assess, in real time, the impact of the interventions on patient-reported function and pain (as measured by the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) as well as physical activity. Participants will be followed for 2 years, with a total of 5 in-person visits.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most prevalent and disabling conditions among Veterans and accounts for high morbidity and high costs for the VA. Importantly, while physical therapy is valuable for patients with KOA, lack of adherence to home exercises and low overall physical activity limit the durability of response. The current proposal aims to address two important knowledge gaps in the management of KOA in order to improve pain and function.","Osteoarthritis, Knee",ALL,PHASE3,"Birmingham VA Medical Center, Birmingham, AL, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233-1927, United States|Omaha VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System, Omaha, NE, Omaha, Nebraska, 68105-1850, United States|VA Portland Health Care System, Portland, OR, Portland, Oregon, 97207-2964, United States|Corporal Michael J.

"This study is a prospective randomized clinical controlled trial testing the effects of pre-operative \>50 g pre-operative carbohydrate fluids (apple juice) on a patient's post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence and intensity. Optimizing fluid therapy in the peri-operative setting has been proven to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications and length of hospital stay. Based on practice guidelines under the American Society of Anesthesiologists, pre-operative hydration with complex carbohydrate drinks is safe and should be encouraged as it helps with improving metabolism to an anabolic state, decreases insulin resistance, reduces anxiety, and reduces PONV. While pre-operative carbohydrate (CHO) fluids have already been studied and adopted by other surgical specialities (Vascular, General Surgery, Orthopaedics, etc.), this has not yet been studied in oral and maxillofacial surgery, especially at Boston Medical Center (BMC).

During surgery, each participant will undergo our current Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ""ERAS"" protocol, which includes general anesthesia using inhalational gas, judicious IV fluids, intra-operative steroid and ondansetron (anti-emetic), use of 0.5% bupivacaine local anesthesia per quadrant at surgery end time, use of a throat pack, and orogastric/nasogastric (OG/NG) tube suctioning prior to extubation to minimize ingestion of blood. Pain and anxiety medications prior to and during surgery include 2 mg midazolam, fentanyl per anesthesia, toradol, and dexmedetomidine. Having this protocol will help minimize confounding variables that could affect the primary outcome-- incidence and severity of PONV.

* To evaluate if pre-operative clear CHO help reduce incidence and intensity of PONV.
* To assess if pre-operative clear carbohydrate fluids affect length of hospital stay
* To determine if pre-operative CHO reduce patient's pre-/post-operative anxiety
* To compare the amount/number of opioids and anti-emetics needed post-operatively between the two groups

"This investigators will conduct a pilot study investigating the implementation of an infertility Patient Navigator (PN) program to mitigate challenges for underserved individuals at Boston Medical Center (BMC) seeking infertility care. The primary objective is to assess whether the PN program can significantly reduce time to completion of infertility evaluation and to initiation of fertility treatment (if recommended) for infertile patients from an underserved patient population.

The study aims are to:

1. evaluate the impact of the PN program on timelines including obtaining commercial insurance coverage for infertility, expediting labwork/imaging, weight management, and partner urology appointments, and initiating fertility treatment; and
2. ascertain the medical literacy of participants with a validated tool to assess the impact of low medical literacy on PN facilitation.

Participants will be contacted by the PN and provided with a survey instrument that will test their medical literacy. Then the PN will assist with scheduling cycle-based testing including labwork and uterine cavity evaluation, the partner's urology appointment, the patient's appointments such weight management/nutrition referral, mammograms (if indicated by age), and insurance counseling if the participant's current insurance does not cover infertility diagnostic testing and treatment. These tasks are part of pursuing fertility care at BMC.

Duration of evaluation and time to treatment in age-matched control patients from the year prior that did not have PN services will be utilized as a comparison group.

"Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a significant neurological problem that commonly follows coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) in elderly patients. This can result in longer hospital stays and generate worsening morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, POCD often persists in some patients for more than a year and puts them at higher risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease or dementia. The cause of POCD is a topic of ongoing work, with recent hypotheses linked with cell dysfunction and death in the brain, and neuroinflammation related to the surgical trauma and related systemic inflammation. In this project, the investigators will test whether the pre-operative use (14 days) of a ketogenic diet (KD), compared to a control diet (CD) will lower the incidence, duration, and severity of POCD in cardiac patients. The ketogenic diet has been associated with improved memory function, as well as reduction of inflammation in conditions such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. A subset of patients from each group will also undergo a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy scan, where key brain metabolites of mitochondrial function and neuronal integrity will be measured in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In the KD group, cerebral b-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) to evaluate cerebral ketosis will also be measured. These will be measured prior to starting the KD/CD and after a minimum of 10 days on the KD/CD. From both CD and KD groups, levels of key cytokines linked with inflammation will be measured during the protocol. Our outcome parameters for POCD will include measures that evaluate cognition, delirium and length of hospitalization. The following hypotheses will be investigated: 1) lower incidence, duration and severity of POCD in the KD group, compared to the CD group; and 2) better pre-operative values of neuronal integrity and in the KD group, higher levels of brain ketone levels will be associated with patients who do not experience POCD or have less severe POCD.

"This project seeks to address the increasing risk of overdose death, substance use disorder (SUD), and opioid use disorder (OUD) in adolescents. The investigators believe that pediatric primary care providers (PCP) could play an important role in helping youth with SUD because most adolescents see their PCPs for annual wellness visits. However, PCPs have many barriers to treating their young patients with SUD/OUD: lack of training, resources, and support to deliver SUD/OUD services, limited time with patients, and the only available referral options often come with long wait times for an appointment.

Through this project, the investigators will build upon an existing Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) system by offering stigma-reduction interventions and brief SUD interventions within primary care settings. The goal of this project is to learn if clinics participating in an Integrated Behavioral Healthcare Program with SUD resources will increase delivery of effective adolescent SUD care and ultimately lead to better health outcomes when compared to standard primary care treatment.

During the first project phase, the research team will gather a Parent and Youth Advisory Board, Primary Care Provider Advisory Board, and Integrated Care Expert Panel (Aim 1) to inform the development and refinement of the primary care-based SUD interventions. The investigators will gather input from national experts, local stakeholders, and PCPs to refine our screening to treatment approach (Aim 2), coupled with stigma reduction activities, within pediatric primary care.

During the second project phase, researchers will assess the impact of SUD IBH on PCP behaviors around adolescent SUD intervention. The investigators will interview and survey PCPs, clinic managers, and other clinical staff for willingness to engage in adolescent SUD treatment. The investigators will evaluate implementation outcomes (views toward SUD, stigma attitudes, IBH team dynamics; Aim 3) and effectiveness/reach outcomes (delivery of integrated primary care-based SUD services, the use of brief interventions for adolescents, number of consultation calls, and increased treatment engagement; Aim 4a), along with an exploratory test of local overdose rates for youth (Aim 4b), in order to examine local effects of the new intervention.

"The ""polytrauma clinical triad"" (PCT), a highly disabling constellation of factors, is defined by the coexistence of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and chronic pain. Veterans with the PCT are medically complex, often refractory to conventional therapies, and suffer from additional related chronic sequela. Notably, sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment, which the investigators hypothesize are significant contributing factors to these functional impairments and an impediment toward rehabilitation. Thus, the investigators' research aims to intervene ""at the level of sleep"", and by improving sleep, improve these interconnected, disabling, and difficult to treat enduring complexities associated with the PCT - ultimately to improve Veteran quality of life, functional independence, and restorative function.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a blood disorder that causes high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. HES can damage the lungs and airways, intestines, skin, and other organs. The current primary treatment for HES can cause serious side effects. Secondary treatments do not work in all people.

Objective:

To test an approved drug (dupilumab), combined with other drugs, in people with HES.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older who take drugs (mepolizumab, reslizumab, or benralizumab) to treat HES.

Design:

Participants will have up to 6 clinic visits and 7 remote visits in up to 48 weeks.

Participants will be screened. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have a test of their heart function. They will take surveys about how HES affects their daily life. Some participants may have a bone marrow biopsy: A sample of tissue and fluid from inside a bone will be removed with a large needle.

Participants will have other tests specific to their symptoms. For example, those with symptoms affecting their lungs will have breathing tests. Others may have tests that target symptoms in their sinuses, gastrointestinal tract, or skin.

Dupilumab is injected under the skin once every 1 or 2 weeks. Dose and timing will vary among participants. They will be taught how to inject themselves at home between clinic visits. They will take dupilumab plus their current medications for 24 weeks. If the drug is helping them, they will continue taking it for another 24 weeks.

Their history with the U.S. parallels that of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Before Western contact, NHPIs had thriving societies with rich cultural traditions. After contact, NHPI communities were decimated to near extinction by infectious diseases, exploited for their cultural and natural resources, displaced from their ancestral lands, forced to assimilate to Western ways, and marginalized through legislative acts and compulsory assimilation policies (i.e., banning native language). The consequences have been high rates of cardiometabolic medical conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

"This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects, best dose, and effectiveness of enfortumab vedotin (EV) in combination with pembrolizumab and radiation therapy for treating patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. Standard of care treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer is chemotherapy, to shrink the tumor before the main treatment is given (neoadjuvant), followed by surgery to remove all of the bladder as well as nearby tissues and organs (radical cystectomy). In cases where patients are not candidates for the standard of care approach or prefer a bladder sparing option, tri-modality therapy with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used. Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. It works by helping the immune system to slow or stop the growth of tumor cells. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy that uses computer-generated images to show the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy reduces the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor.

"The diagnosis of hypertensive disease during pregnancy is predicated on strict blood pressure thresholds: 140/90 on at least two occasions measured four hours apart for both gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. An improvement in diagnostic accuracy of even 5mm Hg would be significant, as reflected by the US Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the British Hypertension Society, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Working Group on Blood Pressure (BP) Monitoring, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)consensus for validation of non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) devices during pregnancy. Given the known inaccuracies of upper arm cylindrical cuff measurements in morbidly obese patients, a conical cuff which provides more accurate measurements will translate into direct patient benefit via more informed diagnosis and management. Fewer women may be exposed to unnecessary treatment, preterm delivery, and/or cesarean section. Recognizing the increasing prevalence of morbid obesity and hypertensive disease amongst pregnant women in the United States, the identification of a more accurate non-invasive cuff is desperately needed. Increasing the accuracy of NIBP measurements on Labor and Delivery has the potential to directly impact the management of tens of thousands of morbidly obese pregnant women diagnosed with hypertensive disease in the United States every year. Establishing the level of agreement between conical forearm and cylindrical upper arm cuffs will shed light on the presence and magnitude of any disparity between measurement methods.

"Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a complex, chronic condition affecting nearly 70,000 Veterans who can experience significantly reduced quality of life (e.g., poorer social, occupational, and health-related functioning). VA clinics providing Medication treatment for OUD (MOUD; e.g., buprenorphine, methadone), the 1st-line treatment for OUD, often face challenges in also attempting to treat Veteran functional needs, which may require them to extend beyond their available resources to provide support. There is an urgent need for functionally impactful and accessible treatments for Veterans in MOUD.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a well-suited framework to support the functioning of Veterans in MOUD with over 20 years of research support. However, the traditional practice ACT requires a trained clinician to provide weekly, hour-long therapy sessions (typically for 12-16 weeks) and may be too burdensome for MOUD clinics to use alongside standard care.

Fortunately, emerging research suggests that mobile health interventions (MHIs; e.g., smartphone apps) can overcome many of these pragmatic barriers. MHIs can efficiently deliver functionally-focused treatments focused on Veteran functioning in ""real-world"" settings, through minimally burdensome and accessible formats. Currently however, no MHI's targeting functioning exist for Veterans in MOUD.

The proposed study will address this gap by developing and evaluating an early prototype of a targeted smartphone app designed to enhance the functional outcomes of Veterans receiving MOUD called ""ACT to RECOVER"" (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to Reach Empowerment through Commitment, Openness, and Valuing Experiences in Recovery).

The study will occur in 3 phases:

Phase 1: Development. Develop content for ACT to RECOVER using Veteran (n=10) and provider feedback (n=10).

Phase 2: Iterative Usability Assessment. Conduct field testing (3 rounds, n=4-5 per round) to refine ACT to RECOVER format, acceptability, and usability.

Phase 3: Pilot ACT to RECOVER in a Stage 1b Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Conduct a pilot trial to compare ACT to RECOVER (n=20) to a smartphone-based symptom monitoring control group (n=20).

* (3a) Evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of each condition's app and study procedures.

"This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects, best dose and effectiveness of regorafenib in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Regorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking BCL-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Azacitidine is in a class of medications called demethylation agents.

"Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 6 million people in the U.S. and are the fifth leading cause of death for adults over 65. Recent research is investigating how chronic liver diseases like Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), which affects one-third of the U.S. population, might influence ADRD through the liver-brain axis. MASLD shares risk factors with Alzheimer's, such as diabetes and hypertension, and studies have linked MASLD to increased risks of cognitive decline and ADRD. Mouse-model studies suggest that chronic liver inflammation in MASLD can induce neuroinflammation and accelerate Alzheimer's pathology, highlighting the importance of studying the liver-brain connection to identify new therapeutic targets for ADRD.

The goal of this research is to develop a practical PET imaging method using 18F-FDG to simultaneously assess liver and brain inflammation in patients with MASLD-related ADRD. This approach leverages dynamic FDG-PET scanning and advanced tracer kinetic modeling to quantify glucose transport, overcoming limitations of traditional imaging methods that cannot noninvasively assess chronic liver inflammation. The new method aims to enable comprehensive imaging of liver-brain inflammation crosstalk, validated against the 18F-DPA-714 radiotracer.

"This study assesses the effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention, mobile Patient Technology for Health (mPATHâ¢-Cloud), compared to usual care among subjects who are overdue for CRC screening according to recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF). The trial randomly selects and enrolls 1,000 eligible subjects served by one federally qualified health center (FQHC) in North Carolina. Subjects are randomized to two study arms, Usual Care (Arm 1) or Mobile Health Decision Support (Arm 2).

Usual care consists of a visit-based screening recommendation to complete a stool test (e.g., FOBT, FIT, Cologuard) or referral to a screening colonoscopy. Subjects randomized to the Mobile Health Decision Support (Arm 2) are sent a message by text or US mail, depending on their preferred communication mode as indicated in the electronic health record (EHR), to visit the mPATHâ¢-Cloud website. Subjects who engage with mPATHâ¢-Cloud are invited to answer brief questions to confirm their eligibility and then view a short decision aid video designed to help people choose the CRC screening test (FIT or colonoscopy) that they would like to receive. After watching the video, subjects can choose a CRC screening test. Their primary care provider at the FQHC orders the appropriate test and, where indicated, refers the subjects to a colonoscopy. Subjects who request FIT screening and subjects who do not select any test receive a FIT mailed to their home address.

The primary outcome of interest is CRC screening completion within 6 months after randomization as assessed by EHR chart review. A completed screening is any of the following: colonoscopy completion (regardless of indication); 2) at least one FIT test with a normal result; or diagnostic colonoscopy following an abnormal FIT result. We hypothesize that we will observe a higher CRC screening completion rate in the Mobile Health Decision Support intervention arm (Arm 2).

"The goal of this clinical trial is to address the high rates of overweight/obesity in Puerto Rican (PR) men. The main question it aims to answer is whether virtual culturally relevant classes supporting physical activity and healthy eating for Puerto Rican men at different levels of acculturation to the US culture, will help these men achieve clinically meaningful weight loss.

The purpose of this project is to assess whether a virtual intervention tailored for Puerto Rican men that includes information about healthy eating, physical activity, sedentary behavior is feasible and acceptable compared to a general health (GH) intervention. It is also to determine whether this intervention leads to healthier eating, increased physical activity, less sedentary behavior (low activity), and clinically meaningful weight loss.

Hypothesis 1: Test the feasibility (recruitment, retention, adherence, fidelity) and acceptability (treatment components, intervention leaders, telehealth modality, technology and equipment, intervention satisfaction, satisfaction with randomized study, and measures) of a randomized 4-month synchronous telehealth lifestyle intervention led by a community health promoter and behavioral health specialist, who will receive either: TeleSalud HE-PA/SB"" or TeleSalud GH in 48 PR men.

Hypothesis 2: Demonstrate proof -of-concept by achieving a clinically significant weight reduction of â¥ 5% of baseline weight in the TeleSalud HE-PA/SB intervention after 4 months and at the end of the 4-month maintenance compared to the TeleSalud General Health intervention.

Researchers will compare this to a group that will receive information about general health topics - not healthy eating or physical activity.

"The STRIVE study is the first national randomized trial to focus on improving well-being, access to surgical care and other health outcomes for transgender and nonbinary (referred to as trans) people seeking genital gender-affirming surgery (GGAS). Trans people have gender identities that are different from the sex they were assigned at birth. Due to discrimination based on their gender identity in settings such as schools, the workplace, housing and health care, trans people face much higher rates of distress as well as poorer health and quality of life. Trans people are often unable to access necessary surgeries and hormone therapy to help align their bodies with their gender identities due to a lack of trained medical providers and limited insurance coverage for gender-affirming care.

The most common GGAS that trans people seek is vaginoplasty, which is the surgical creation of vaginal anatomy. Because of the high demand for this surgery and limited number of medical centers that offer it, trans people face lengthy wait times and complicated health system processes, increasing stress, negative mental health effects and social isolation. Social and peer-support interventions have been shown to decrease isolation and improve health. Social support during the GGAS process was also identified by the Transgender and Non-Binary Surgery - Allied Research Collective (TRANS-ARC) as the top research priority. Due to limited information on this topic, the STRIVE study was developed to meet this need.

The research team's goals are to:

* Compare the effectiveness of two approaches to presurgical preparation for vaginoplasty: a virtual group-based peer support intervention led by trans peers who have had GGAS, or usual care delivered by gender-affirming surgical teams, enhanced with patient education materials.
* Determine if the intervention improves meeting presurgical criteria for vaginoplasty.
* Evaluate if patients, peer supporters and healthcare staff find the intervention acceptable.

The research team will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, meaning participants will be assigned by chance to one of two groups: peer-support group or usual care enhanced with written and web-based education materials. This study is pragmatic because it is happening under real-life conditions to understand if the intervention will work in practice.

The research team will work with five academic gender-affirming surgery programs across the country to recruit and enroll 260 trans adults ages 18 and older who are seeking vaginoplasty. Participants assigned to the peer support group will receive the intervention virtually over the course of three months, facilitated by peer facilitators from Trans Lifeline. The usual care group will receive education from their gender-affirming surgical team, with in-depth materials that cover the same topics as the virtual course.

The primary outcome to be measures at six months is coping self-efficacy, reported by patients, using a survey which assesses perceived ability to deal with stressors. The research team will explore additional outcomes at 12 months, including meeting GGAS presurgical criteria and other outcomes deemed important to trans community partners, surgeons and other gender-affirming providers (e.g., psychological stress, social support, resilience, quality of life, presurgical knowledge, surgical delays and cancellations). Postsurgical outcomes, including surgical satisfaction and other related outcomes, will be measured at 24 months. Finally, the team will conduct in-depth interviews with participants who undergo the intervention to understand their experiences at the beginning of the study and after six months. Researchers will also interview peer supporters and clinicians to understand how to improve and implement the support intervention more broadly.

In designing this study, the research team worked closely with trans community members and patients, health services and policy researchers, gender-affirming surgeons, advocates, gender program administrators and representatives from social support organizations. Collaboration with and input from the trans community during the conduct of this study will be critical to ensure that the STRIVE study is patient centered. Results from this study will be shared in multiple forms, including clinical guideline recommendations, policy briefs, patient-centered reports, web-based information and summaries for clinicians and researchers. Trans people seeking gender-affirming surgery can use the study findings to understand options for social support to improve quality of life and health outcomes.

"Generalized anxiety disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of tension and worry with physical symptoms including increased blood pressure. Approximately 20% of US adults reported an anxiety disorder in the past year and an estimated 31% of US adults reported anxiety at some time in their lives. Anxiety can be experienced throughout one's life and levels of anxiety can increase with stressful life events, physical health conditions, and medication use. Chronic, untreated anxiety has been linked to headaches, dizziness, depression, high blood pressure, heart disease, digestive disorders, and a worsened immune system - greatly impacting one's overall quality of life (QOL).

Anxiety and depression are highly comorbid, with approximately 50-60% of those with anxiety symptoms also experiencing depression symptoms. Experiencing these disorders and symptoms comorbidly may further worsen one's mental health and overall QOL. Untreated, chronic depression can heighten symptoms of depression leading to increased risk of heart disease, sleep disruptions, weight gain/loss, a weakened immune system, physical pains, and suicide attempts.

Anxiety and depression are commonly treated using various psychotherapeutic techniques including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy techniques administered by a licensed therapist. However, therapy has many barriers to treatment including insurance not covering treatments, overall treatment cost, unsure where to seek treatment/no access to a therapist, and therapy being unavailable and inconvenient due to scheduling during the workday. As such, app-based mental health tools have increased in popularity to improve access and affordability to effective mental health treatments.

The purpose of the study is to examine the effectiveness of a guided anxiety/depression app-based program by Headspace, which uses CBT with mindfulness to improve anxiety and depression symptoms in a population with elevated baseline anxiety and/or depression.

Patients may experience individual symptoms of LARS or a combination of them. A bowel management program assists patient's with identifying a specific bowel management regimen that works best for managing symptoms of LARS. A RRE consists of inserting a catheter through the anus into the rectum. The RRE is designed to assist fecal emptying. Medical management of LARS can include the use of fiber, loperamide hydrochloride, or pelvic floor physical therapy. Fiber may help relieve constipation, feelings of incomplete bowel movement, or bowel emptying difficulties. Loperamide hydrocholoride may help lessen fecal urgency, incontinence, or increased frequency. Pelvic floor physical therapy may help restore strength in the rectum possibly helping to improve symptoms of LARS. Participating in a bowel management program with a RRE may be more effective in treating LARS than medical management alone.",Low Anterior Resection Syndrome|Rectal Carcinoma,ALL,EARLY_PHASE1,"Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States"

This study compares the experiences of people who receive information about genetic testing from a computer-generated character to patients who receive information from a human genetics healthcare provider. Patients with cancer are increasingly recommended for genetic testing as standard of care. Multiple factors contribute to low usage of genetic testing but for many patients the lack of access to genetic counseling and testing is an important and flexible factor. Lack of access is especially relevant to racial/ethnic minority patients and those living in non-metropolitan rural settings who are frequently cared for at safety-net hospitals with limited genetics services. Alternative delivery models are necessary to improve rates of access to genetic testing in patients with cancer. Health information technology is under used by genetics providers. A patient-facing relational agent (PERLA) will provide pre-test genetics education in both English and Spanish across two clinical settings to facilitate more timely access to genetic testing. Using the PERLA intervention may help researchers learn different ways to provide education about genetic testing to patients with cancer compared to usual care.,Breast Carcinoma|Male Breast Carcinoma|Malignant Solid Neoplasm|Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma|Ovarian Carcinoma|Pancreatic Exocrine Neoplasm|Stage IVB Prostate Cancer American Joint Committee on Cancer v8|Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,ALL,NA,"USC / Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, 14642, United States"

"The survival of children, adolescents and young adults (AYA) with acute leukemia has improved dramatically over the last two decades. This success is a result of using multiple chemotherapy drugs in combination, with the inclusion of drugs that enter the brain and prevent leukemia cells from growing there. Studies in these cancer survivors have shown that the exposure to these chemotherapy drugs can lead to risks for impaired brain function, also referred to as neurocognitive side effects of chemotherapy. There is an opportunity to identify participants at risk for these side effects and to prevent their development. The purpose of this study is to incorporate a brain imaging tool known as Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) to look for brain matter changes in acute leukemia participants receiving chemotherapy. The MRF scan will be performed at diagnosis and repeated at multiple times during the entire therapy duration as well as at defined intervals after therapy is complete. Investigators would also do an electronic test of memory and brain function (cognitive function), which would be administered in a gaming format on iPads or a similar device. The goal will be to correlate results of MRF imaging with the tests of cognitive function. The benefits of this imaging technique include that it can be done quickly (in minutes), it is non-invasive, it is resistant to motion-artifacts and it can be easily repeated for comparison purposes. The advantages of the cognitive test include its short duration of 20 minutes and its gaming format making it friendly for children to use.","Acute Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Pediatric|Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Children|Myeloproliferative Neoplasm",ALL,NA,"University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106, United States"

"Chronic constipation is a feature of children with cystic fibrosis (CF). This is postulated to be a result of inhibition of secretory activity of the gastrointestinal luminal cells due to ineffective chloride channel function. Typical laxatives that work as osmotic agents fail to produce adequate relief in this population.

Maralixibat is a non-systemic bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi) that acts by interrupting bile acid reabsorption in the ileum thus interrupting the normal enterohepatic circulation. This interruption results in a larger volume of bile acids reaching the colon and being excreted in stool. Bile acids are known to decrease bowel transit time, increase mucosal permeability and secretions, as well as alter gut microbiota resulting in diarrhea.

The overarching hypothesis of the study is that Maralixibat will improve stool consistency in children (Age \<18 years) with cystic fibrosis and constipation (Bristol Stool Scale \<4). Specifically, we aim to test the hypothesis that IBATi improves the consistency of stool to Bristol scale \>4 in children with CF and constipation.

We will recruit a total of 20 patients with CF and constipation (defined as Bristol Stool Scale \<4 for 1 week prior to enrollment while on a stable laxative regimen for at least 4 weeks.) Design is a 'Within-Subjects' study by which each enrolled patient will take Maralixibat for 2 weeks total in addition to their stable laxative regimen during the study. Stool consistency \& ease of defecation will be recorded before and during the study period by families of enrolled patients via materials provided by the investigators. Stool consistency and ease of defecation will be compared before and after initiation of Maralixibat.

Objective:

To test higher or lower doses of belinostat based on gene variants in people with HGNEC.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with HGNEC.

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. Some blood will be used for genetic testing. They will have imaging scans and a test of their heart function. Samples of tumor tissue may be collected.

"This is a Phase II parallel group randomized controlled trial with 294 adolescents (age: 14-21 years) with alcohol and other drug \[AOD\] use disorder (hereafter substance use disorder), that compares two different active psychosocial interventions designed to address adolescent substance use disorder. Participants are recruited from our clinical settings and the community at two sites: one in the metro Boston, Massachusetts (MA) area and the other in the metro Farmington, Connecticut (CT), area.

Study aims and hypotheses are as follows:

1. To extend the evidence for the initial efficacy of Integrated Treatment for Enhancing Growth in Recovery During Adolescence (InTEGRA), which integrates 12-Step Facilitation (TSF) with Motivational Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT) relative to gold standard MET/CBT alone (N = 294). It is hypothesized that youth assigned to InTEGRA will have greater 12-step participation during and following treatment, higher abstinence rates, and fewer substance-related negative consequences.
2. Investigate the personal recovery capital (PRC) and social recovery capital (SRC) mechanisms of behavior change through which InTEGRA may confer benefits dynamically over time (e.g., PRC: motivation, self-efficacy, coping; SRC: 12-step involvement; social network changes).
3. Investigate moderators of InTEGRA's effects on outcomes across one-year follow-up (e.g., effect of age, network support for AOD use; psychiatric severity; age composition of 12-step meetings on substance use and substance-related consequences). It is hypothesized that higher network support for AOD use, abstinence motivation, and greater AOD severity, will have a better response to InTEGRA.

"The e-OPRA Implant System, is a further development of the OPRA (Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees) Implant System. The e-OPRA Implant system is an implant system for direct skeletal anchorage of amputation prostheses. The added feature in the e-OPRA Implant system, is a bidirectional interface into the human body that allows permanent and reliable communication using implanted electrodes. These electrodes will provide long-term stable bioelectric signals for an improved control of the prosthetic limb. The Magnetic Bead Tracking System, which will be implanted and used in combination with the e-OPRA Implant system, is an investigational device that consists of pairs of magnetic beads, and a set of magnetic field sensors that measure and track the length of muscles and the speed at which they move in real-time. When the beads are implanted in muscle in the residual limb of an amputee, the muscle length signal is communicated to an investigational, robotic ankle-foot prosthesis. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a transtibial amputee with the e-OPRA Implant System and Magnetic Bead Tracking System exhibiting full neural control over a neuro-mechanical prosthetic system.

Cottonseed oil (CSO) is found readily in the food supply, and the investigator's previous studies have demonstrated that incorporating CSO into the diet is sufficient to improve fasting cholesterol profile and improve postprandial lipid and/or glycemic responses in both healthy, and at-risk populations. This study aims to compare CSO to a fatty acid composition-matched diet, on changes in fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism and markers of chronic disease risk.

The specific aims are:

* Examine the impact of CSO vs. PUFA on fasting and postprandial lipids.
* Examine the impact of CSO on other markers of chronic disease risk.

Participants will be asked to:

* Consume provided meal replacement shakes daily for 28-days.
* Attend three weekly short visits for fasting blood draws, body measurements, and collect the next week of study materials,
* Attend two longer (5.5h) testing visits which include eating a standardized breakfast meal and having blood drawn periodically before and after breakfast.

Researchers will compare CSO vs. PUFA and control groups (receiving a mixture of oils) to see if CSO is unique in imparting health benefits when compared with similar matched oil diets.","Dyslipidemia|Overweight and Obesity|Nutrition, Healthy",ALL,NA,"University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 30602, United States"

"This phase II trial tests how well photoradiation with verteporfin and pembrolizumab plus standard of care chemotherapy works in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or to other places in the body (metastatic). Photoradiation uses light activated drugs, such as verteporfin, that become active when exposed to light. These activated drugs may kill tumor cells. Vertoporfin may also increase tumor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as modified fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX), work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

At screening, the Principal Investigator (PI) evaluated subjects' perioral rhytid severity (using the Perioral Rhytid Severity Rating Scale; PR-SRS) to confirm eligibility and to establish a pre-treatment score for assessing aesthetic improvement.

At Visit 1, RHAÂ® Redensity with new anesthetic agent was administered in a random sequence (first or second injection) and side of the mouth (left or right) and RHAÂ® Redensity with lidocaine was administered to the other side. Study subjects and the PI injecting study devices were blinded.

Immediately after injection of an upper perioral quadrant, subjects rated the injection site pain experienced during injection using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Injection site pain in each side of the mouth was also assessed at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after injection of the upper quadrant.

"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive modality that utilizes electrical currents to modulate pain in populations with acute and chronic pain. TENS has been demonstrated to produce hypoalgesic effects in postoperative pain, fibromyalgia, knee osteoarthritis, and healthy subjects. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (TaVNS) is a non-invasive modality that modulates the vagus nerve by stimulating its auricular branches. The effects of the combination of TENS and TaVNS on producing an analgesic response have not been studied. Considering that TENS and TaVNS both stimulate similar analgesic pathways but through different means of activation, the investigators can hypothesize that a combination of both methods can produce a more pronounced analgesic response. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the hypoalgesic effect of a combination of TENS and TaVNS in pain-free subjects.

The study will be a simple crossover design conducted at the University of Hartford. Subjects will be recruited from the University of Hartford population via oral communication, digital flyers, and posters on campus. Thirty participants will undergo two sessions in a crossover manner with one week in between. During one session, the participants will receive TENS with active TaVNS and the other session will be a placebo procedure (TENS with placebo TaVNS). The order of these sessions will be randomized.

"The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a brief video intervention emphasizing peer inclusion on depression-related stigma and stigma outcomes (e.g., help seeking attitudes, secrecy) among adolescents 14-18.

Timely identification and treatment of depression in adolescents is a public health priority. However, most youth with depression do not seek treatment, and stigma has been identified as the primary barrier to help-seeking. Experiments have found brief video-based interventions (BVIs), 1-2 minute videos similar to those viewed by youth on social media platforms, based on the principle of ""social contact"" with individuals affected by a stigmatized condition, effective in reducing depression-related stigma and increasing help-seeking among adolescents. However, given the extreme time constraints of these videos, optimizing the messaging is paramount. Prior research has indicated that concerns about peer social inclusion are fundamental in shaping stigma among adolescents.

In this 3-arm RCT, we will recruit adolescents aged 14-18 using an online crowdsourcing platform, to test the efficacy of a) standard BVI that addresses mental health treatment but does not address concerns about peer inclusion/exclusion, b) novel BVI focused on mental health treatment and peer inclusion, and c) control condition that provides information without social contact.","Depression|Adolescent - Emotional Problem|Stigma, Social|Help-Seeking Behavior",ALL,NA,"New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York, 10032, United States"

"The opioid crisis continues to plague the United States. While great strides have been made nationwide to decrease overprescribing, improvements are still needed to appropriately educate patients on the safe and responsible use, storage and disposal of opioids. Pain after surgery is often treated with opioid medications. Opioid medications can have side effects. Some side effects are relatively minor (constipation, nausea, vomiting), while others are more severe (sedation, abnormal breathing, etc.) and can lead to serious illness or death. Opioid pain medications when used the wrong way may also be addictive. Due to theses side effects, sometimes patients feel uncomfortable about taking these medications, and doctors prescribe them very cautiously. However, when used properly and safely, opioid pain medications are excellent pain relievers.

Addinex, a technology company, has developed a device to help patients take opioids more safely. In this study the investigators aim to enroll a total of 30 patients who undergo spine surgery. Half will be randomly assigned to receive a standard pill bottle with opioids at discharge and will download a mobile app so that they can record their daily pain scores and the number of opioids they take for two weeks after surgery. The other half will receive the new opioid dispenser filled with opioids and a mobile app that generates a passcode that opens that device only at designated times. For this group of patients, every time the patient wants to take an opioid, they need to go to the app, enter their pain score before the app generates a passcode. The investigators will be tracking all study patients' opioid use and pain scores for the two weeks after surgery, will count how many pills they have left over 14 days after their surgery during a live telehealth session, and ask patients how they liked using the device. Results from this study will help understand if the Addinex device could potentially be useful to patients in the future after surgeries as opposed to typical pill bottles.","Opioid Use|Pain, Postoperative|Medical Device|Laminectomy|Diskectomy",ALL,NA,"Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York, 10021, United States"
"This phase IB/II trial tests the safety, side effects and effectiveness of glofitamab plus ibrutinib with obinutuzumab for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Glofitamab is in a class of medications called bispecific monoclonal antibodies. It works by killing cancer cells. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). In the body, glofitamab binds to a receptor called CD3 on T-cells (a type of immune cells) and a receptor called CD20 on B-cells, a receptor that is often over-expressed on the surface of cancerous B-cells. When glofitamab binds to CD3 and CD20 receptors, it causes an immune response against the CD20-expressing cancerous B-cells. Ibrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of cancer cells.

"This study is for patients that have lymph gland disease called Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease and the patients condition has come back or has not gone away after treatment, including the best treatment we know for these diseases.

Some patients with Lymphoma or T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease show signs of virus that is sometimes called Epstein Barr virus (EBV). This virus causes mononucleosis or glandular fever (""mono"") before or at the time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. This suggests that the EBV plays a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells (in lymphoma) and some immune system cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction.

T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in blood and affect the tumor. We have treated over 80 people on studies using T cells to target these diseases. About half of those patients who had disease at the time they got the cells had responses including some patients with complete responses (meaning the cancer could no longer be detected).

We think that if T cells are able to last longer in the body, they may have a better chance of killing EBV and EBV infected tumor cells. Therefore, in this study we will add a new gene to the EBV T cells that can cause the cells to live longer called C7R. We know that T cells need substances called cytokines (substances such as proteins released by specific cells of the immune system) to survive and that the cells may not get enough cytokines after the cells are infused into the body. We have added the gene C7R that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a longer period of time.

The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of C7R-EBV T cells, and additionally to evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have on the cancer.","Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Leukemia, B-cell|Leukemia, T-Cell|Lymphoma",ALL,PHASE1,"Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|The Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States"

"The incidence of kidney stone disease continues to rise globally. Although the treatment of kidney stone disease has dramatically improved in recent years, surgical management remains invasive and expensive. Patients who develop kidney stones are at high risk of recurrence during their lifetime; therefore, prevention of stones should be a primary focus. Low levels of citrate and acidic urine are risk factors for the formation of kidney stones such as calcium oxalate and uric acid, respectively. Calcium oxalate stones are the predominant stone composition in the United States, accounting for over 2/3rds of stones. Citrate is a key inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal formation and thus increasing it in the urine of a calcium oxalate stone former is quite beneficial. Uric acid stones account for approximately 10 percent of all stone types. These stones form primarily due to an acidic urinary environment which is a prerequisite for crystal formation. Common medications for stone formers include potassium citrate which help to make the urine more alkaline. Although effective, these medications have side effects and may prove to be too expensive (upwards of $450/month). Consuming baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) may prove to be an inexpensive ($0.34/month) equally effective alternative with respect to increasing urinary citrate levels and alkalinizing the urine.

"The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the use of hypofractionated radiation (delivery of fewer but larger doses of radiation) with concurrent chemotherapy for women with metastatic of bulky uterine cervix cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the MRI-assessed rate of response at 1-month and 3-months post-treatment?
* What is the safety and tolerability of cisplatin-based hypofractionated pelvic Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) followed by brachytherapy?
* What is the median progression-free survival and overall survival at 1 and 2 years for patients who undergo cisplatin-based hypofractionated pelvic IMRT?
* What is the proportion of patients who complete the treatment in prescribed timeframe?
* What the levels of cervix cancer circulating tumor cells pretherapy and after treatment?

To confirm eligibility, within four weeks prior to study enrollment, all patients will undergo the following:

* Complete history and physical exam, GOG performance status evaluation
* Standard of care scans, which include staging CTs and/or PET scans, and MRI to verify eligibility and appropriate stage of disease. Blood tests will be done to check various organ functions.

Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.

The main difference between the proposed regimen in the trial and standard of care is as follows:

1. The trial has a shortened course of EBRT. Standard of care utilizes 25 treatments, also known as ""fractions"" of EBRT, while the trial utilizes 8 fractions of EBRT. An equivalent ""biological effective dose"" is achieved by increasing the radiation dose per fraction.
2. The concurrent cisplatin dosing is shortened from 5-6 cycles of cisplatin to 2 cycles of cisplatin. The dose of cisplatin is 40 mg/m2.

This protocol requires photon IMRT technique followed by high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. The therapies use focused energy beams to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy must be completed within 30 days +/- 2 days of initiation. Computed tomography simulation with the patient in a head-first laying on back-supine position is required. MRI-guided treatment planning and image guidance during treatment for motion management will be used.

IMRT will be given once daily Monday-Thursday, four fractions per week. The high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy following institutional protocol. Brachytherapy will be delivered twice per week with a 2-day break in between sessions. A total of four brachytherapy treatments will be delivered.

After active therapy is completed, treatment-related toxicity will be assessed at the 1-month post-treatment completion visit and again at the 3-month post-treatment completion. Patients removed from the study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event(s).

Routine MRI imaging to assess treatment response to radiotherapy is conducted at Day 15. Treatment response to radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy will be assessed at the 1- month and 3-months post-treatment completion.

Following the 3-months post-treatment completion, study participants will be followed for disease progression and survival status until Year 2 post-treatment initiation.

"Background:

Interstitial lung disease affects the tissues that aid the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the bloodstream. The disease can cause fibrosis, a thickening and scarring of lung tissue. Fibrosis often continues getting worse, and most people with this disease die in 3 to 5 years.

Objective:

To test a study drug (hymecromone) in people with interstitial lung disease or lung fibrosis.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with interstitial lung disease or lung fibrosis.

Design:

Participants will have at least 7 clinic visits over 5 months.

Participants will have screening and baseline visits. They will have blood tests and tests of their heart function. They will give a sputum sample. Other tests will include:

Spirometry: Participants will breathe in and out through a mouthpiece to measure how much air they can hold in their lungs and how hard they can breathe.

Diffusion capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide: Participants will breathe in a gas that contains a small amount of carbon monoxide. Then they will breathe through a mouthpiece. This test measures how well oxygen moves from the air into the blood.

Resting energy expenditure. Participants will lie still for 30 minutes with a clear dome over their head. This test measures the calories their body burns at rest.

"Stroke is a leading cause of disability. Most stroke survivors face challenge in using their arm and hand to carry out daily task, such as grasping or holding objects. This issue makes it tough for nearly 65% of stroke survivors to return to work and take care of themselves. The cause of their disability is changes in their brain's activity patterns of the motor cortex area. Traditional therapy does not directly alter these brain changes, which makes it less effective. As a way to help stroke survivors, people are looking into ways to train the brain directly. A method they found is motor imagery, which involves mental practicing of a task. Studies suggest that this type of training can potentially alter the brain's patterns, which can be seen through EEG. An EEG shows a fixed pattern during movement, called SMR (sensory motor rhythm). Studies have found that people can learn to control this SMR through mental practice of a task. The SMR changes in a similar way during both movement and motor imagery. Therefore, mental practice of hand tasks can lead to improvement in actual hand movements. It has already been shown that stroke survivors can open their hands more easily after receiving SMR training. Along with that, they also have trouble to hold and release objects. SMR training may be able to address these issues by changing brain patterns. But it is not clear yet if SMR training can improve all three stages of grasping (open, close, release), and to what extent it can enhance overall hand function.

This study plans to include 20 adults who have experienced a stroke and have ongoing problems with moving their hands. Half of these participants will take part in a training in which they will learn to control their SMR for three distinct hand tasks (open, close, and release). The first session will be followed by eight training sessions. To guide users toward specific changes in EEG activity, we will provide visual feedback in training. As soon as an appropriate EEG change is made, a hand exoskeleton will help them open and close their hand. The other group of 10 patients will have traditional therapy. They will do 9 sessions of hand exercises. During and after the training, we will test both groups to see how well their hand function improved. The result will help us determine which training method is better for stroke survivors.",Stroke,ALL,NA,"Hand Rehabilitation Lab, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27695, United States"

"There are currently 6.7 million Americans living with dementia and, without significant breakthroughs, this figure will double to 12.7 million by 2050. There are about 46,000 long-term care (LTC) facilities in the U.S. More than half of LTC residents have some form of dementia (Alzheimer's Association, 2018). Responsive behaviors and dysfunction of the dementia care triad-i.e., the PLWD, professional Care Partner (CP), and Family Member (FM)-are inexorably linked. The emergence of responsive behaviors can lead to disruption of the triad's function. Thus, it is imperative to maintain positive relationships and a high quality of life (QoL) within the triad to reduce BPSD. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) has demonstrated improvements in QoL and relationships for PLWD. CST is a psychosocial intervention that promotes communication and engagement in PLWD via a structured program of meaningful and enjoyable theme. While clinical trials have shown improvement in cognition and QoL, the potential large-scale impact of CST has been hampered by low adherence, with less than 40% completing trials. One likely reason for the low adherence to CST is the reliance on generic and non-digital tools (e.g., paper-based agendas, tools, DVDs, and board games) in facilitating the intervention. That is, even though CST aims to be personalized, the specific interventions used in the field tend to be generic and not tailored to each PLWD's specific interests. The use of digital technology to implement CST would offer considerable advantages to expand and personalize the range of stimulation content and provide a means for monitoring responses, optimizing protocols, and promoting adherence.

The proposed Phase II study will involve the continued development and evaluation of a multi-faceted software platform called ""Building Relationships using Artificial Intelligence and Nostalgia"" or BRAIN. The BRAIN Platform will be the first-ever Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered CST digital therapy platform for PLWD. The platform, which has been shown to be effective in an initial Phase I clinical trial, has three main goals: to improve the quality of life of PLWD, to reduce BPSD in PLWD, and to foster positive relationships between members of the care triad. The proposed Phase II project has the following Specific Aims: 1. Create an improved Beta version of the BRAIN Platform's eight components: (1) the Admin Management Dashboard, (2) the Annotation Dashboard, (3) the Log Viewer, (4) the Content Management System (CMS), (5) the Private CMS, (6) the Control App, (7) the Home App, and (8) the Training Dashboard. 2. Fine-tune the different classes of AI algorithms-i.e., behavioral analytics, personalized content recommendation, and personalized program generation-in the BRAIN app such that they can (a) recognize and track 12 distinct behaviors and indicators of PLWD, (b) use these behavioral traits as a basis for automatically rating the relative success of each activity, and (c) automatically recommend personalized activities that are likely to be successful for individual PLWD. 3. Conduct a Cluster Randomized Trial (CRT) of the BRAIN App to examine the app's impact on engagement/affect, quality of life, and responsive behaviors. 4.

"The goal of this clinical trial is to characterize to understand the effects of a type of cell therapy called Chimeric Antigen Receptor T lymphocyte (CAR T) therapy in adult patients with the autoimmune disease dermatomyositis. This study will utilize a technology that modifies a type of white blood cell called the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-this T cell normally functions in the immune system to kill infected or potentially harmful cells in the body. In CAR T therapy, the patients' white blood cells are harvested and the cytotoxic T cells are isolated and modified such that they are programmed to kill any cell that has a protein structure called ""CD19"" on its outer surface (membrane). Since the CD19 protein is only present on a type of white blood cell called the B lymphocyte, when these ""re-engineered"" cytotoxic T lymphocytes are then given back to the patient (by an infusion), these cells will seek out and kill essentially all of the patient's B cells. B cells are an important part of a person's immune system and have many functions, including the production of antibodies. It is thought that, in dermatomyositis and other autoimmune diseases, a tiny subset of these B cells plays a large role in making autoantibodies (antibodies directed against the patient's own tissues) and causing disease. The idea is that the therapy will ""wipe out"" all/most of the B cells in the patient so that they can make an entirely new set of B cells to recreate a functional immune system without the autoimmune disease.

The main questions the study intends to answer are:

* Understanding how well patients tolerate undergoing this therapy in terms of side effects;
* Getting an early idea if this therapy can help certain aspects of the autoimmune disease, including inflammation in the skin, muscles, and lungs;",Dermatomyositis,ALL,PHASE1,"Stanford University, Stanford, California, 94305, United States"
"Opioids are often added with a local anesthetic to enhance the duration and quality of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery patients. However, spinal opioids are associated with a wide variety of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, (N/V) and pruritus (itching). The occurrence of pruritus can vary between 30% and 100% making pruritus the most common side-effect of intrathecal opioids and this rate is even higher in pregnant patients. Pruritus may require treatment which can be ineffective or sometimes reverse the analgesic effect of the opioids. Ondansetron is a safe and very commonly used Serotonin receptor antagonist treatment for local anesthetic opioid-induced pruritus used in pregnancy.

"In this research study, the investigators want to learn more about the safety and effectiveness of a fetal surgery, known as fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP), for the treatment of a pregnancy condition called vasa previa (VP). Vasa previa is a pregnancy complication that happens when blood vessels from the fetus grow over the entrance to the womb. In a VP pregnancy, natural vaginal birth is deadly for the baby in more than half of cases due to the bursting of VP vessels and severe blood loss. Currently, VP patients are recommended to be closely monitored and often hospitalized once they reach the third trimester of pregnancy. An early delivery by C-section would typically be performed in order to avoid breaking the exposed fetal vessels.

Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation is a minimally invasive surgery in the womb to remove or correct abnormal blood vessels and tissues. In the FLP procedure, the surgeon uses a fetoscope (a tiny telescope) and a laser device to seal off unprotected vessels. While this surgery has been used to treat other pregnancy conditions, it has not yet been proven to be safe and/or effective for the treatment of vasa previa. This treatment aims to eliminate the VP, and, if successful, may have the potential to minimize the risk of bleeding, thereby enabling patients to avoid long hospitalization before delivery.

"Rotator cuff (RC) injuries are particularly prevalent, difficult to repair, and attachment between the bone and tendon is notoriously difficult to achieve.

Radiation-induced dry mouth is a frequently experienced symptom and persists after treatment, potentially indefinitely. Current practice does not specifically attempt to spare the parotid ducts, where stem/progenitor cells are believed to preferentially reside, and considers the entire salivary gland to have equal function. New radiation therapy planning and conducting strategies are needed to reduce this toxicity and maximize patient quality of life post-treatment.

"This phase II trial tests how well ibrutinib works in preventing chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing donor (allogeneic) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). An allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a treatment in which a person receives blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) from a genetically similar, but not identical donor. When healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into a patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make more healthy cells and platelets. However, sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can attack the body's normal cells (called GVHD). Giving ibrutinib after the transplant may stop that from happening. Ibrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking a protein in the blood called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). By blocking BTK, ibrutinib inhibits certain immune cells that play a role in cGVHD.

"Background:

Chronic heavy drinking can cause alcohol use disorder (AUD). AUD changes how the brain works. People with AUD may drink compulsively or feel like they cannot control their alcohol use. Acamprosate is an FDA-approved drug that reduces anxiety and craving in some, but not all, people with AUD.

Objective:

To learn more about how acamprosate affects brain function in people with AUD.

Eligibility:

People aged 21 to 65 years with moderate to severe AUD.

Design:

Participants will stay in the clinic for 21 days after a detoxification period of approximately 7 days.

Acamprosate is a capsule taken by mouth. Half of participants will take this drug 3 times a day with meals. The other half will take a placebo. The placebo looks like the study drug but does not contain any medicine. Participants will not know which capsules they are taking.

Participants will have a procedure called electroencephalography (EEG): A gel will be applied to certain locations on their scalp, and a snug cap will be placed on their head. The cap has sensors with wires. The sensors detect electrical activity in the brain. Participants will lie still and perform 2 tasks: they will look at different shapes and press a button when they see a specific one; and they will listen to tones and press dedicated buttons when they hear the corresponding tones.

Participants will have 2 EEGs: 1 on day 2 and 1 on day 23 of their study participation. They may opt to have up to 4 more EEG studies (one on day 13 and one on each of the three follow-up visits) and 2 sleep studies, in which they would have sensors attached to their scalp while they sleep.

"The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of HTR2 T cells that is safe, to see how long these cells last in the body, to learn the side effects, and to see if these cells are able to fight and kill HER2 expressing breast cancer.

Patients eligible for this study have metastatic breast cancer that has HER2 expression and has progressed on at least one line of therapy. This is a gene transfer research study using special immune cells called T cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that helps the body recognize and fight cancer cells.

The body has different ways of fighting diseases and no single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from infectious disease and possibly cancer. T cells, or T lymphocytes, are special blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have shown promise treating cancer but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

Previous research has found that investigators can put genes into T cells that helps them recognize cancer cells and kill them. Investigators now want to see if by putting a new gene in those T cells to help recognize breast cancer cells expressing HER2 can kill the cancer cells. In clinical trials for various cancer types that express HER2, our center engineered a CAR that recognizes HER2 and put this CAR into patients own T cells and gave them back. Investigators saw that the cells did grow and patients did tolerate and respond to the treatment.

Investigators will add a gene to the HER2 recognizing CAR T cells that will improve the T cells function. Investigators know that some immune cells in the body can lower T cells ability to kill cancer cells. Investigators have identified an antibody that will inactivate those immune suppressive cells thereby allowing T cells to survive better to recognize and kill cancer cells. This antibody targets the Trail-R2 receptor and is referred to as TR2.

Also, investigators know that T cells need the support of cytokines to perform their immune functions. There is evidence showing that the addition of interleukin 15 (IL15) enhances CAR T cells ability to kill cancer cells. As a result, investigators also added IL15 to the HER2 and TR2 targeting CAR T cells (HTR2 T cells).

The HTR2 T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.","Breast Cancer|Tumor, Breast|Breast Tumor|Malignant Neoplasm of Breast|Mammary Cancer|Mammary Neoplasm|Mammary Neoplasms, Human|Neoplasm, Breast",ALL,PHASE1,"Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States"

"Early life experiences, such as those associated with stable attachment, supportive relationships, and nurturing environments, have profound effects on lifelong physical and mental health. However, children have very different levels of access to such experiences, depending on their family characteristics and associated risk and resilience factors. Low-cost interventions aimed at improving infant environments offer a promising avenue for reducing inequality in early experiences because they require minimal effort to implement. Previous work from the Music lab showed the promise of infant-directed vocalizations, especially music, for enriching parent-infant interaction. Such behaviors are cross-culturally universal, appear regularly in the context of infant care, and have robust effects on infant psychophysiology. In recently completed pilot work, it was found that a brief smartphone-based music intervention achieved high adherence and low attrition; led parents to increase their use of music in soothing their fussy infants; and improved infant mood, as reported via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Together, these findings show the potential for enriched parent-infant interaction, particularly via infant-directed singing, to improve infant and parent health. Here, a Phase II randomized trial is proposed to explore such effects. Parent/infant dyads (N = 192, infant starting ages 0 to 4 months) will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) music with enrichment, where parents receive a smartphone-based intervention to learn to sing interactively with their infants, via the early childhood music program Music Together; (2) music with limited enrichment, where parents receive music recordings to listen to with their infants, but are not provided with enrichment activities; (3) enrichment with limited music, where parents receive books to read interactively with their infants, but are not provided with music activities; or (4) a no-treatment control. Throughout the 8-month study, a text-message-based EMA and a survey battery will be used to measure key health outcomes for both infants (distress and recovery, sleep quality, and mood) and parents (mood, mental health status, and parenting efficacy); potential moderators of such effects (demographics, family contextual factors, parent/infant attachment, and infant temperament); as well as parents' degree of engagement in the interventions. Effects will be analyzed both across the intervention groups and relative to the no-treatment control to determine the relative effects of each intervention. The results of this work will determine the effects of low-cost, low-effort early enrichment interventions on basic, everyday health outcomes for infants and parents, test the feasibility of app-based interventions and data collection tools (including in socio-economically disadvantaged families), and provide rich data on the daily lives (including mood, temperament, and sleep variables) of families with young infants.

"This is an open-label phase I study of fostamatinib in combination with ruxolitinib for the treatment of chronic GvHD with a suboptimal response to corticosteroids. The primary objective is to identify a minimum safe and biologically effective dose of fostamatinib when combined with standard of care ruxolitinib for the treatment of steroid refractory and steroid dependent cGVHD. The secondary objective is to estimate the efficacy of the combination of ruxolitinib and fostamatinib for the treatment of steroid refractory and steroid dependent cGVHD.

The target enrollment is 24-30 subjects. The study will begin with an initial dose escalation cohort employing a modified 3+3 design to investigate up to three doses of fostamatinib. Using safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamic (PD), and pharmacokinetic data (PK), an interim assessment will be performed to determine two candidate doses of the biologically optimal dose to investigate further. A safety expansion cohort will be opened to backfill these two candidate doses up to a total 12 patients per dose, including those in the dose escalation cohort who received the candidate doses. Patients will then be randomized to one of these two candidate doses in the expansion. If there is an imbalance in the two expansion cohorts, the remaining patient slots after 1:1 randomization will be sequentially backfilled to a total of 12 patients per cohort. A final analysis of safety, efficacy, and PK/PD data in patients who received the two candidate doses will be conducted to determine a minimum safety and biologically effective dose, which will be the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

Studies in rodents show that ketamine may not only improve depression in PD, it may target two of the underlying drivers of the disease: (1) reduced neuroplasticity, or the brain's ability to adapt and remodel itself; and (2) elevated inflammation. The investigators are conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled study to examine if a dose of intravenous (IV) ketamine improves depression in Veterans with PD. The investigators will also examine ketamine's effects on neuroplasticity and inflammation, which will help us understand how ketamine works in PD and if it can be a useful treatment for Veterans with the disease.

"American Indians are more likely to die from heart disease compared to other people in the United States. High levels of fat (lipids) and sugar (glucose) in the blood are related to heart disease. Young American Indians who are 18 to 39 years old have high lipid and glucose levels. This has led to heart disease later in life. This means they are likely to benefit from a program to lower these levels.

In this project, researchers will work with American Indians in rural southwestern Oklahoma. The researchers will start by asking American Indians how they would like to design a program for younger members of their community. After getting permission, the researchers will take a small amount of blood from young community members. The researchers will measure lipid and glucose levels and ask those with high levels to be in the study. Then the researchers will do several measurements. These will include blood pressure, height, weight, diet, physical activity, sleep, tobacco and alcohol use, access to health care, and social support. The researchers will compare these measurements to similar measurements taken from young American Indians 20 years ago, collected through the Strong Heart Study, which is the longest running study measuring heart disease in American Indians.

Next, the researchers want to know if the program they developed with the American Indian communities will work. To do this, they will put people in one of two groups. They will decide which group each person will be in using a process that is like flipping a coin (heads for one group, tails for the other group). One group will receive educational booklets about how to avoid getting heart disease. The other group will receive help from a community health worker. The community health worker will help participants to get to the doctor for treatment. They will also help participants change their diet and exercise routines and provide education about heart disease risk factors. After 9 and 18 months, the researchers will repeat the measurements to see if one of the groups has lower lipid or glucose levels.

This program will support the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's mission to ""reduce human disease"" by lowering lipid and glucose levels, which are related to getting heart disease. This will be done by using the community health worker model to help people go to the doctor and improve their lifestyle related to diet and exercise. The researchers will also be able to advance heart health in American Indians in rural Oklahoma by lowering factors related to heart disease.","Cholesterol, Elevated|Diabetes Mellitus",ALL,NA,"University of Oklahoma Heath Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73104, United States"

"The goal of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) in reducing cigarette smoking. Although there are safe and effective treatments for smoking cessation, not everyone who attempts smoking cessation is successful, even with these treatments. Relapse rates are high, leaving a need for new approaches. Despite justification to evaluate CBD for this indication, human research on the topic is scant. Larger, more extended studies are warranted and essential.

We will recruit participants from CRI-Help, Inc., a substance abuse treatment program in North Hollywood, where residents who indicate the desire to stop smoking are prohibited from using other cannabis products which would affect recruitment.

The aims of this study are:

1. Evaluate the effects of CBD on reduction of cigarette use. The primary endpoint will be reduction in cigarette use, indexed by self-reported cigarettes/day and plasma cotinine.

   The secondary endpoint will be abstinence from smoking, indexed categorically by self-report and confirmed biochemically by expired carbon monoxide (CO) during the last 2 weeks of the trial.
2. Evaluate CBD effects on participant retention. The primary endpoint will be retention in the trial, indicated by number of days that participants continue in the trial.

   Secondary endpoints will be nicotine dependence and withdrawal (measured weekly on the FagerstrÃ¶m Test for Nicotine Dependence and Minnesota Withdrawal Scale, respectively), and mood states (measured weekly on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 screener).
3. Exploratory Aims. Measure CBD and endocannabinoids. Plasma concentrations of CBD, N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), will be measured at baseline and at specified times throughout the trial. The primary endpoint will be CBD plasma level.

"Surgical resection and liver transplantation are the primary curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, many patients are ineligible for these treatments due to advanced disease, social factors, or limited availability of liver donors. Therefore, for patients with unresectable HCC, locoregional therapies like transarterial radioembolization (TARE with Y90) are considered the next best non-operative option, especially when the cancer remains confined to the liver. Despite the use of these liver-directed therapies, relapse rates and mortality remain high, underscoring the need for new predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets, including immune modulation.

The rationale behind NP-101 (TQ formula) stems from its immune modulatory properties as a potent drug derived from a natural substance, black seed or Nigella Sativa. Previous studies have demonstrated its immune modulation and anti-cancer effects, showing promise in preclinical models of HCC. In a randomized phase 2 study conducted in Covid patients, NP-101 exhibited safety and significantly increased T effector cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes), resulting in accelerated recovery. The immune modulation effect of NP-101, observed in the Covid study, and its potential to enhance CD4+ and CD8+ T effector lymphocytes can potentially modify the immune microenvironment and improve outcomes in locally advanced HCC patients undergoing Y90 treatment.

This study will investigate the safety, efficacy and maximum tolerated dose of NP-101 in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

The dosing scheme for NP-101 in this study will follow a Bayesian Optimal Interval design. Based on the target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 30% and assuming a 3+3 design, three subjects will be sequentially enrolled at each of the 3 dose levels (beginning with 3g) until at least one DLT occurs.

If no DLTs occur, dosing will be escalated to the next dose level for the next three enrolled subjects. At either of the two dose levels, if 1 DLT occurs, three more subjects will be enrolled at that dose level. If no DLTs occur in these subjects, three more subjects will be enrolled at the next highest dose level. Dosing escalation will be stopped if two or more total DLTs occur at any dose level.

"Background: A quarter of US Veterans reside in rural communities and are significantly older than their urban counterparts. Providing timely access to care is especially important in this older, independent and medically complex cohort. Virtual care, by phone or video, has improved access to care in non-surgical specialties; however, its utilization in surgery is less than 10% and has continued to decline after the COVID pandemic. Recent studies in surgical patients have demonstrated no difference in missed adverse events, emergency department visits or readmissions; but these data are limited to routine, low-risk procedures in large, urban centers. Routine telehealth for low and high-complexity surgery could be of particular benefit to rural patients by reducing travel challenges, costs, improving scheduling flexibility and reinforcing independence. The hypothesis is that routine telehealth follow-up for elective surgical procedures, of all complexity, will provide equivalent outcomes and improved patient satisfaction and access in comparison to face-to-face follow-up.

Significance: VA Integrated Service Network (VISN) 19 is the largest geographic region in the VA system and includes four intermediate/complex VA Medical Centers (VAMC) serving rural and urban patients across 10 states. Almost 4000 unique patients are seen annually at these 4 centers resulting in 2600 operations and over 16,000 patient encounters. Another 2500 unique patients are referred to community care (CC) at a cost of over $5 million in FY23. Improving access through telehealth in this largely rural VISN will positively impact Veterans and reduce community care expenditures in addition to improving patient and provider satisfaction.

Innovation \& Impact: There are currently no funded or published randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of telehealth in providing postoperative surgical care to rural patients. The proposal will provide robust, Level 1 data confirming the safety of postoperative telehealth care. In addition, the investigators will provide the only evaluation of both the patient and provider experience in rural, surgical telehealth care. They will leverage the largest geographic region, VISN19, to ensure broad applicability of findings to rural and urban Veterans.

Specific Aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the safety of postoperative telehealth in rural and urban Veterans. Aim 2: Evaluate the usability and patient satisfaction of telehealth in comparison to in-person postoperative follow-up. Aim 3: Evaluate the usability and provider satisfaction of telehealth in comparison to in-person follow-up.

Methodology: Patients undergoing elective general surgical procedures (both inpatient and outpatient) at four VA medical centers (Denver, CO; Oklahoma City, OK; Muskogee, OK; Salt Lake City, UT) in VISN 19 will be randomized to post-operative follow-up in person or via telehealth. Patients who discharge with drains or wound vacuum therapy, permanent suture or staples will be excluded. Aim 1: 30-day morbidity, missed adverse events (complications that may have been recognized with in-person follow-up), 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission, and 30-day ED visits will be compared evaluated to determine safety of telehealth follow-up. Aim 2: Post-operative surveys at 6 weeks after surgery will quantify acceptability of telehealth follow-up via the standardized Telehealth Usability Questionnaire; satisfaction and usability will be compared via the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery survey (S-CAHPS) between the groups. Patients will also be characterized by baseline demographics, distance to nearest facility, socioeconomic vulnerability and procedure type to further define optimal cohorts for future telehealth participation and implementation. Aim 3: Usability and satisfaction for Providers will be determined by self-developed survey. Bi-monthly responses will be recorded to define trends and optimize future implementation.

Next Steps/Implementation: If safe and acceptable to patients and providers, standardization for telehealth follow-up after surgery can be implemented nation-wide to improve access to care and satisfaction.",Surgery,ALL,NA,"Rocky Mountain Regional VAMC, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Eastern Oklahoma VAMC, Muskogee, Oklahoma, 74401, United States|Oklahoma CIty VAMC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73104, United States|Salt Lake City VAMC, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84148, United States"

"The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells.

Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

In order to get them to kill cancers more effectively, in the laboratory, the study team inserted a new gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) into T cells that makes them recognize cancer cells and kill them. When inserted, this new CAR T cell can specifically recognize a protein found on solid tumors, called glypican-3 (GPC3). To make this GPC3-CAR more effective, the study team also added two genes called IL15 and IL21 that help CAR T cells grow better and stay in the blood longer so that they may kill tumors better. When the study team did this in the laboratory, they found that this mixture of GPC3-CAR,IL15 and IL21 killed tumor cells better when compared with CAR T cells that did not have IL15 plus IL21 in the laboratory. This study will use those cells, which are called 21.15.GPC3-CAR T cells, to treat patients with solid tumors that have GPC3 on their surface.

The study team also wanted to make sure that they could stop the 21.15.GPC3-CAR T cells from growing in the blood should there be any bad side effects. In order to do so, they inserted a gene called iCasp9 into the FAST-CAR T cells. This allows us the elimination of 21.15.GPC3-CAR T cells in the blood when the gene comes into contact with a medication called AP1903. The drug (AP1903) is an experimental drug that has been tested in humans with no bad side-effects. This drug will only be used to kill the T cells if necessary due to side effects .

The study team has treated patients with T cells that include GPC3. Patients have also been treated with IL-21 and with IL-15. Patients have not been treated with a combination of T cells that contain GPC3, IL-21 and IL-15. To summarize, this study will test the effect of 21.15.GPC3-CAR T cells in patients with solid tumors that express GPC3 on their surface.

"The goal of this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial is to test the effect of 12 weeks of orally administered MitoQ (mitoquinol mesylate) supplementation on cognition in 50 people with early phase schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (E-SSD) who have mitochondrial dysfunction (called high risk, or HR). Cognitive impairments in SSD can cause significant disability. Yet, there are no effective treatments for cognitive impairments in SSD. It has been shown that alterations in a certain type of brain cell (parvalbumin interneurons, or PVI) underlie cognitive deficits in SSD. These PVI, which fire at a fast rate, utilize high amounts of energy from the mitochondria and are highly vulnerable to oxidative stress. MitoQ is an antioxidant. Research has shown that, in mice, MitoQ can reduce oxidative stress in the mitochondria. The main question that this clinical trial aims to answer is:

â¢ Does MitoQ supplementation, compared to placebo, improve cognition in HR patients?

Secondary questions that this clinical trial aims to answer are the following: Does MitoQ supplementation, compared to placebo:

* Improve positive and negative symptoms of SSD in HR patients?
* Improve functioning in HR patients?
* Improve/normalize blood markers of mitochondrial dysfunction in HR patients?

The investigators will enroll 100 individuals with E-SSD. These enrolled participants will participate in an initial screening visit to determine if they qualify for the actual clinical trial. At the screening visit, the investigators will ask about psychiatric history to determine diagnosis; ask about medical history; do a physical exam; collect blood and urine samples; do a pregnancy test; and ask participants to bring in their current medications in their original packaging so it is known what they are taking.

After the screening visit, the investigators will invite 50 HR patients (identified with a blood test) to continue with the clinical trial. Participants who qualify for the clinical trial will be asked to:

* Take a supplement (MitoQ or placebo) once per day for 12 weeks in addition to their usual medications.
* Come in for a study visit every 4 weeks over the 16-week study period.

"Anxiety and depression symptoms occur at high rates in Veteran populations and can significantly impact function, compromising the ability to work and to successfully form and maintain valued relationships. Several other symptoms commonly occur with anxiety and depression, including poor sleep quality and chronic pain. Since all these symptoms frequently occur together, they may have a common underlying biological basis. A single medication that could effectively treat all these symptoms would be ideal. Converging data suggest that pregnenolone is a promising pharmacological agent for treating multiple psychiatric symptoms and functional impairment. The investigators thus propose to conduct a clinical trial of pregnenolone in Veterans with anxiety and depression symptoms. Pregnenolone has minimal side effects, and the prior research demonstrates that pregnenolone is well-tolerated by Veterans.

"Class 4 obesity is defined as a BMI â¥50Kg/m2, representing approximately â¥150 pounds of excess weight. For patients with Class 4 obesity, metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is the only effective treatment. However, MBS is associated with a higher rate of perioperative morbidity and mortality for patients with Class 4 obesity. Additionally, more patients with Class 4 obesity experience suboptimal weight loss. For patients with Class 4 obesity, preoperative weight loss can reduce the technical difficulty of surgical procedures, rendering MBS safer. Preoperative weight loss may also decrease visceral adipose tissue and liver volume as well as reduce weight-related comorbidities.

A very low-calorie diet (VLCD), which involves restricting caloric intake to approximately 800 kcal/day, is one strategy to help patients achieve weight loss preoperatively. Although studies show that a VLCD prior to MBS yields weight loss, reduces liver volume and rates of perioperative complications, most preoperative VLCDs are short (2-8 weeks) with variable adherence. To date, no study has systematically assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a standard 12-week VLCD among patients with BMI â¥50 pursuing MBS. No study has evaluated postoperative weight loss among patients who have undergone a preoperative VLCD.

This study will be a single arm trial designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week VLCD program prior to sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and associated weight loss up to 1 year following MBS. The investigators will enroll 24 patients aged 18-70, with a BMIâ¥50Kg/m2, and are approved for SG. Participants will consume up to 5 meal replacement protein shakes and 2 cups of vegetables daily for 12 weeks. Participants will attend weekly in-person office visits with the clinicians at the Hartford Hospital Medical and Surgical Weight Loss Center in Glastonbury, CT to assess weight loss, physical and mental health, feasibility and acceptability of and adherence to the VLCD. The investigators hypothesize that a 12-week VLCD is feasible in this population, defined as â¥70% (18 out of 24 participants) completing the program. The investigators hypothesize that better attendance at the weekly visits and higher adherence to the diet recommendations will provide greater weight loss preoperatively and percent total weight loss at the completion of VLCD, on the day of MBS, and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Findings from this study may lead to additional projects that aim to develop and implement an optimal pre-surgery and post-surgery clinical care model for bariatric patients.",Obesity,ALL,NA,"Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut, 06102, United States"
"The goal of this clinical trial is to understand the communication occurring between Black and Caucasian patients and their transplant providers during transplant evaluation consultations and assess relationships between these communicative elements and patient and provider factors, patient-reported outcomes and living donor transplant outcomes - living donor referrals, evaluations, and transplants. We will use these findings to inform the development of a communication skills training for transplant providers and test the impact of the training on providers' communication about live donor kidney transplants with Black and Caucasian patients and living donor transplant outcomes.

"Spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of disorders that cause severe disability and can be fatal. There are currently no known disease-modifying treatments available for use, and there is a critical need to find treatments that slow disease progression and allow affected individuals to live more functional lives. Aerobic training show promise as a treatment for these diseases, but it is unclear if training induces neuroplastic changes within the damaged cerebellum to enhance motor learning, or if improvements are primarily caused by changes in leg strength, fatigue, and endurance. It is crucial to understand how the training impacts the brain, and particularly the cerebellum, in order to determine the most effective training regimen.

To examine the impact of aerobic exercise on the brain, we propose using eyeblink conditioning, a form of motor learning that is dependent on the cerebellum. We will utilize BlinkLab, a newly developed smartphone application, that overcomes the typical barriers of testing eyeblink conditioning by allowing in-home assessments without the need for expensive equipment. We hypothesize that: 1) individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia will have impaired eyeblink conditioning, and 2) aerobic exercise, but not balance training, will improve eyeblink conditioning in this population. If these hypotheses are found to be true, it would further support that aerobic exercise is able to enhance motor learning in individuals with cerebellar damage.

In AIM 1, we will test eyeblink conditioning in individuals with ataxias and follow them over time to see if eyeblink conditioning might be a biomarker for cerebellar ataxia disease progression. We will then use these preliminary results to devise a larger study to further validate eyeblink conditioning as a biomarker for ataxia disease progression. In AIM 2, we will determine the impact of training on eyeblink conditioning. We expect that aerobic training, but not balance training, will enhance eyeblink conditioning in spinocerebellar ataxia. Finally, in AIM 3, we will explore the use of eyeblink conditioning as a biomarker of neuroplasticity.",Spinocerebellar Ataxias,ALL,NA,"Columbia University/New York Presbyterian, New York, New York, 10035, United States"
"This study involves patients that have a cancer called diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL), or classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (referred to collectively as lymphoma). Patients' lymphoma has come back or not gone away after treatment.

A previous research study at Baylor combined two ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that bind to bacteria, viruses and other foreign substances to prevent disease. T-cells are special infection-fighting white blood cells that can kill tumor cells or cells infected with bacteria and viruses. Both have shown promise treating cancer, but neither has been strong enough to cure most patients. In the previous study, an antibody called anti-CD30 which is found on the surface of some T-cells and cancer cells, and had been used to treat lymphoma with limited success, was joined to the T-cells through a process called gene transfer, resulting in CD30.CAR T cells.

Another study saw encouraging responses using CD30.CAR T cells made in a lab from a patients' own blood then injected back into the same patient to treat their lymphoma. These cells are termed 'autologous' because they're given back to the original patient.

In an ongoing study, patients were treated with allogeneic CD30.CAR T cells, which are made from healthy donors instead of the patients. The use of allogenic cells avoids a lengthy manufacture time since the products are stored as a bank and available on demand. This ongoing trial has preliminarily shown promising clinical activity with no safety concerns.

With the current study, investigators plan to extend the anti-cancer effects of the CD30.CAR T cell by attaching another molecule called C7R, which has made CAR T cells have deeper and longer anticancer effects in the laboratory. The aim is to study the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic banked CD30.CAR-EBVST cells that also carry the C7R molecule, to learn the side effects of C7R modified CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in lymphoma patients, and to see whether this therapy may help them. As an extra safety step, the C7R containing T cells will also have a marker called iC9. If a patient experiences intolerable side effects from the C7R T cells, they could receive a medication called 'rimiducid' that can eliminate the C7R containing T cells by binding iC9, thereby potentially resolving the side effects. While not yet FDA approved, rimiducid has been tested in patients before without bad side effects.","CD30-Positive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, T Cell and Null Cell Type|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, ALK-Positive|Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, ALK-negative|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Hodgkin Lymphoma",ALL,PHASE1,"Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States"

"Cigarette smoking in the U.S. is highest among low income and Medicaid insured adults, and unfortunately, low-income smokers are even less likely to attempt to quit, less likely to use evidence-based treatments, and thus less likely to be successful. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which generally provide healthcare services to low income and Medicaid insured patients, are more likely to serve individuals who use tobacco and are required to report tobacco use screening rates and their delivery of cessation interventions. Thus, FQHCs are an ideal community-partner to reach low-income smokers, particularly smokers who are not currently seeking treatment. To address this gap, the investigators developed a pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation intervention to help facilitate nicotine replacement therapy medication adherence among smokers. The proposed study aims to examine the feasibility of delivering the pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation intervention to FQHC patients who are ready to quit, and expanding the intervention for smokers not ready to quit by adding 2 pre-quit sessions focused on rate reduction.

"Lower back pain (LBP) is one of the most common causes of disability, with 68% of adults over 60 years of age suffering from chronic Lower Back Pain (cLBP). In addition to the exacerbation of physical, social and emotional health issues, LBP has a staggeringly high US economic burden. Community-dwelling older adults experience a significant amount of chronic pain and treatments that are effective in their younger adult counterparts (e.g., pain medications, exercise) are often not safe or feasible. Our long-term goal is to decrease cLBP and improve function in older adults residing in continuing care retirement communities (CCRC). Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA), a promising treatment for cLBP, is an auricular (ear-based) treatment intended to compliment traditional allopathic medical treatments for acute and chronic pain. Auricular acupuncture has been implemented and used widely in the US military. Despite emerging evidence supporting the use of BFA in chronic pain, BFA has not been used to treat older adults with cLBP residing in CCRC. To this end, we propose an adapted group BFA protocol for CCRC residents. We will determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing group BFA for cLBP at the University of Iowa (UI) Family Medicine-affiliated CCRCs by evaluating patient participation rates and retention, comfort with the protocol and satisfaction with the sessions, protocol delivery and ease of use. We will also determine treatment effectiveness by evaluating pain scales in cLBP, pain medication use, mobility, and falls.

"Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a debilitating musculoskeletal disease that is characterized by localized death of bone cells and associated cellular elements within the subchondral bone. If it progresses, it results in the collapse of the femoral head (ball part of the hip) giving rise to secondary arthritis. This condition is associated with marked pain and loss of function, often necessitating a joint replacement. Due to the relatively young age of onset of ONFH (often in 20s and 30s), there is great interest in utilizing joint-preserving procedures prior to the need for joint replacement. Joint-preserving procedures include core decompression (CD) with and without bone grafts or cells, vascularized and non-vascularized bone grafting, as well as osteotomies. Inconsistent results for each of these procedures have been reported and there are no Clinical Practice Guidelines or medical community consensus opinions regarding the treatment of early-stage ONFH. The hypothesis to be tested is ""Participants who have early-stage ONFH undergoing CD augmented with autogenous bone marrow aspirate concentrate will have better clinical and radiological outcomes than CD alone.""

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack tumor cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's tumor cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. Some solid tumor cells have an L1CAM protein on their surface, and T cells can be modified with a receptor, called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), to help recognize this protein and kill these tumor cells. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. These L1CAM mutation specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill L1CAM locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancers' tumor cells.",Prostate Carcinoma|Prostate Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma|Stage III Prostate Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IV Prostate Cancer AJCC v8,MALE,PHASE1,"Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium, Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States"

"The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn whether existing treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be improved. Two treatments for PTSD, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) will be studied. CPT and PE are effective treatments that are widely available, but interventions are needed to improve patient outcomes in these treatments. The investigators have developed an Adjunctive Writing intervention for Amplifying Response and Engagement (AWARE), which was designed using health communication strategies to enhance CPT and PE by improving communication between patients and therapists about patients' experiences in treatment. This research will investigate whether adding AWARE to CPT and PE will lead to better treatment outcomes compared to CPT and PE provided as usual without AWARE. AWARE includes a brief writing task asking patients about their experiences in treatment, as well as guided therapist responses to improve patient-therapist communication about patients' experiences in treatment. In the first phase of the study (case series phase), CPT or PE with AWARE will be provided to four adults with PTSD to pilot test adding AWARE to CPT and PE, seek patient and provider feedback, and refine AWARE. The first four participants who enroll will be part of the case series and will receive CPT or PE with AWARE. Then, in the second phase of the study, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) phase, the investigators will enroll 50 more adults with PTSD who will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive CPT/PE as usual or CPT/PE with AWARE. It is expected that 25 participants will be randomized to CPT/PE with AWARE and 25 participants will be randomized to receive CPT/PE provided as usual. The goals of the RCT phase are to study whether AWARE is acceptable to patients, whether it is feasible to add AWARE to CPT and PE, and whether adding AWARE to CPT and PE improves patient-therapist communication and treatment outcomes compared to CPT/PE as usual.","Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",ALL,NA,"National Center for PTSD at VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts, 02130, United States"

"Healthcare systems around the world, including within the United States, have long-established shortages of trained caregivers. The American Health Care Association states that ""the health care system has experienced a shortage of trained caregivers for critical roles for some time."" This scarcity directly impacts the 45,800 Long-Term Care (LTC) communities throughout the U.S.

Concurrent with this staff shortage, more than half of LTC residents have some form of dementia. These two issues create a serious public health concern, since dementia is associated with a variety of behavioral expressions, such as aggression, anxiety, and agitation. Behavioral expressions of dementia can be successfully managed with the use of tailored, psychosocial interventions and communication support. Unfortunately, existing staff shortages make the facilitation of such interventions challenging.

One powerful and often-overlooked approach to ameliorating staffing shortages involves the utilization of retired volunteers to facilitate interventions for persons with dementia (PWD). Based on the nearly universal love of music and a promising pilot study, the product to be developed and tested in this STTR will build upon the combined prior work of the Principal Investigators. Making Connections Thru Music (MCTM), an urgently needed product, will enable retired volunteers to facilitate an evidence-based music and discussion intervention with PWD. MCTM aims to improve engagement, enhance quality of life, and reduce behavioral expressions in PWD. The intervention will consist of two main components: (1) a comprehensive online training course for volunteers, which will provide a general overview of dementia, demonstrate effective communication strategies to use with PWD, and instruct volunteers to effectively facilitate MCTM sessions, and (2) an app containing a structured MCTM intervention protocol and toolkit, which will be the means by which volunteers facilitate MCTM.

"Exercise is routinely recommended because of its benefits for physical, cognitive, and mental health. It is especially beneficial for older adults due to its potential buffering effects against Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (Luck et al., 2014). However, little is known about how to best encourage older adults to exercise. Based on behavior change theory, different intrapersonal and interpersonal motivational factors are likely to be relevant during the contemplation, action, and maintenance stages of behavior change. Generally, as a result of motivational shifts toward prioritizing positivity and socially meaningful goals with advancing age (Carstensen, 2006), socioemotional aspects of decision making may become more salient and influential for older adults (Mikels et al., 2015; Peter et al., 2011). Our previous work has demonstrated that positive affect (Mikels et al., 2020) and social goals (Steltenpohl et al., 2019) play a critical role in older adults' motivation to exercise, but these two lines of research have not been integrated to date. Recent work indicates that positive affect is particularly beneficial for health when shared in social connections (Fredrickson, 2016; Major et al., 2018), and the proposed work will, for the first time, examine how shared interpersonal positivity may impact exercise decision making and behavior, especially during the contemplation and action/maintenance stages of behavior change.

But who are the older adults that benefit the most from exercise in terms of physical, cognitive, and mental health (and should be hence be targeted with messages)? Not all older adults reap the benefits of exercise (Sparks, 2014) and, conversely, sedentary older adults have the most to gain. Overall, the current proposed research program is innovative in its (a) translational application of insights from affective, cognitive, and aging theory and research to understand the antecedents and outcomes of exercise decision making in younger and older adults, (b) conceptualization of both the social and emotional aspects of decision making, (c) development of novel methods for health messaging that incorporate social influences, and (d) novel assessments of the exercise-health link.",Motivation|Aging|Health Behavior|Emotions|Social Behavior,ALL,NA,"DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois, 60614, United States"

"Fibromyalgia is a debilitating chronic pain disorder. Based on prior research with MDMA, it can be hypothesized MDMA-assisted therapy in fibromyalgia patients may increase the range of positive emotions, interpersonal trust, and heighten the state of empathic rapport that can lead to an enhanced patient-clinician interaction and to initiate reattribution processes targeting dysfunctional thoughts towards pain. Therapeutic alliance, i.e. a positive patient-clinician relationship, is already acknowledged as an essential component for MDMA-assisted therapy.

"The clinical trial is intended to assess for clinical evidence of Clemastine Fumarate as a myelin repair therapy in patients with acute inflammatory injury-causing demyelination as measured by multi-parametric MRI assessments.

No reparative therapies exist for the treatment of acute demyelinating lesions. Clemastine fumarate was identified along with a series of other antimuscarinic medications as a potential remyelinating agent using the micropillar screen (BIMA) developed at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Following in vivo validation, an FDA IND exemption was granted to investigate clemastine for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in the context of chronic optic neuropathy. That pilot study was recently completed and is the first randomized control trial documenting efficacy for a putative remyelinating agent for the treatment of MS. The preselected primary efficacy endpoint (visual evoked potential) was met and a strong trend to benefit was seen for the principal secondary endpoint assessing function (low contrast visual acuity). That trial number was 13-11577.

This study seeks to follow up on that study and examine clemastine fumarate's protective and reparative effects in the context of acute demyelinating brain lesions as imaged by multi-parametric MRI assessments. The investigators will be assessing the effects of clemastine fumarate as a remyelinating therapy and assessing its effect on MRI metrics of lesions found in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute inflammatory injury-causing demyelination.

In addition to using conventional multi-parametric MRI assessments, this study will also evaluate a new MRI technique called Ultrashort Echo Time (UTE) MRI to assess the effects of clemastine fumarate as a remyelinating therapy of acute lesions found in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute inflammatory injury-causing demyelination and compare it to the other assessments.","Demyelinating Diseases|Demyelination; Corpus Callosum|Multiple Sclerosis Brain Lesion|Multiple Sclerosis Acute and Progressive|Clinically Isolated Syndrome, CNS Demyelinating",ALL,PHASE1|PHASE2,"Sandler Neurosciences Building, Neurological Clinical Research Unit, San Francisco, California, 94107, United States"

"Developed nations worldwide are currently enduring a health crisis, as chronic diseases continue to decrease quality of life and promote additional disease states or even death for much of the population. Rural populations are at a particular disadvantage, as they lack access to health clubs, wellness programs and similar resources that are more available in urban areas. Although pharmaceutical therapies have continued to show therapeutic advancements, the rates of disease onset and death from chronic disease has not seen similar improvements, and in fact continue to worsen. Excitingly, significant evidence has been published demonstrating an affordable, effective treatment to directly treat and prevent these chronic diseases, but few have demonstrated successful implementation of this therapy, which is improved lifestyle. Specifically, physical activity and healthy body composition are powerful therapeutics that have been demonstrated to effectively combat and prevent chronic diseases. Additionally, improving these lifestyle factors are often more effective than pharmaceutical interventions without the wide range of side effects.

"Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is defined as a three-dimensional lateral deformity of the spine. It is described with a cobb angle of greater than 10 degrees. There is no known etiology of AIS. Once the degrees of curvature become severe (greater than 45 degrees), surgical intervention (posterior spinal fusion - PSF) is often discussed. Most adolescent patients and their families opt for surgical correction to decrease future complications of severe scoliosis, such as decreased vital capacity of the lungs, potential future activity restrictions, cosmetic appearance, and self-esteem. While the patient and family are eager to undergo PSF, they do have concerns. The major concerns are pain control and their ability to return to activities.

In current literature, there are many studies completed regarding pharmacologic pain control management with the use of IV patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids, narcotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxers, Tylenol, and gabapentin. However, there is not a well-established multimodal pain management plan for postoperative PSF patients. There is also no current literature discussing nonpharmacologic pain management methods, such as stretching, strengthening and yoga, for patients undergoing PSF. There are multiple studies discussing core stabilization used for helping AIS patients non-operatively. There is no literature discussing the use of nonpharmacologic pain management methods for improved pain control (including decreased use of pharmacologic agents) and quicker return to activities.

"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication following cardiac surgery and leads to worse outcomes. POAF is thought to be caused by the inflammatory state following cardiac surgery. It may be that anti-inflammatory medications could lower the occurrence of POAF, however many typical anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, are contraindicated in the post cardiac surgery patient due to increased risks of bleeding. If a drug was identified with anti-inflammatory properties with minimal deleterious side effects, this could be broadly applied to cardiac surgery patients for the prevention of POAF. Interestingly, several small trials have shown that medications that alter transcription of inflammatory markers lead to decreased POAF. Furthermore, we have shown that phytochemicals, such as those found in grapes, have excellent bioavailability and can affect cardiac gene transcription related to inflammation. In this study, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative administration of concentrated grape powder in the prevention of POAF.",Post-operative Atrial Fibrillation (POAF),ALL,PHASE1|PHASE2,"University of Michigan - Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, United States"

"This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of anti-HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor (TCR)-transduced autologous T lymphocytes (A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells) in treating patients with NY-ESO-1 overexpression positive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed/recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory), and that may have spread from where it first started (primary site) to nearby tissue, lymph nodes (advanced) or to other places in the body (metastatic). NY-ESO-1 is an antigen found on the surface of many different types of tumor cells including TNBC. Antigens make it possible for immune cells to recognize and kill germ cells that invade the body, however, it is more difficult for immune cells to recognize antigens on tumor cells. T cells are a special type of immune cell in the blood. These T cells may be trained to recognize the NY-ESO-1 antigen on tumor cells, allowing the T cells to attack and kill those tumor cells. The A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells are T cells that have been removed from the patient's blood through a process called leukapheresis and then changed in the laboratory to recognize NY-ESO-1 on tumor cells. When given back to the patient, these A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells find and attack tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. They are given before the T cells to support optimum activity of the A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells. IL-2 (aldesleukin) is in a class of drugs known as cytokines. It is a man-made version of a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the body to produce other chemicals which increase the body's ability to fight cancer.

"This research study is being done to develop a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that can enable severely paralyzed individuals to interact with the world through direct brain-control of a computer. This technology is named MindEx (for Mind Extender). It utilizes four implanted ""chips"" in the human brain from which investigators can record brain activity during subjects' thoughts and decode meaningful information from this activity to be used as control signals for a computer, a laptop, or a tablet. The use of four brain regions is a significant differentiating feature and scientific innovation of this study over much prior work in this space, that typically derived control signals from one, or sometimes two brain regions. The brain regions to be used here can allow the decode of multiple variables simultaneously, including not just moment-to-moment position, but also high-level goals, intentions, decisions, scene comprehension, and error-related signals involved in natural human behavior. The research is being done through a prospective, longitudinal, single-arm early feasibility study to examine the safety and effectiveness of using MindEx to provide the user an intuitive, efficient, and accurate ability to control multiple applications on a computer interface such as a word processor, a paint application, or to play simple video games.

"Background:

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide. These cancers have different causes, with smoking/tobacco exposure and human papilloma virus infection being the most common. . When HNSCC occurs in people who are not infected with HPV, the cancers are more likely to return after treatment; when this happens, overall survival is only about 10 months, thus better treatments are needed.

Objective:

To test a combination treatment using 2 drugs (valemetostat and pembrolizumab) in people with HNSCC. Phase 1b of the study will determine a recommended dose of the 2 drugs and evaluate how safe the combination is.; this will include patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC, as well as squamous cell NSCLC that have progressed on anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapies.Phase II will determine how effective the combination is and will focus on patients with HPV-negative HNSCC.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with HPV-negative HNSCC, sinonasal carcinoma of the head and neck, or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests and tests of their heart function. They will have imaging scans. They may have a biopsy: A small sample of tissue will be removed from the tumor.

"Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP) are procedures that have the potential to create tiny particles suspended in the air. These particles can contain germs such as viruses. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience unusually high rates of critical illness that needs advanced airway management and intensive care unit admission. Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation, endotracheal Intubation (ETI) and chest compressions are sometimes required for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and may contribute to a high risk of infection amongst Health Care Workers (HCW). To lessen HCW risk during high-risk procedures, a device called an aerosol box has been developed to place over the head of the patient, shielding the provider's face from virus droplets suspended in the air.

The purpose of this research study is to better understand how particles disperse during AGMPs, more specifically during the provision of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The project team hopes what is learned from the project can help inform infection control measures. This could help make changes to the clinical environment and make it safer for HCW's.

"Some people who have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 can experience long-term effects from their infection, known as post COVID-19 conditions (PCC) or long COVID1. The medical circles often describe it as post-acute sequelae of Covid-19 (PASC). People with post-COVID conditions can have a wide range of symptoms that can last more than four weeks or even months after infection. Sometimes the symptoms can even go away or come back again. The Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) listed a constellation of 19 symptoms related to post COVID-19.

In research, brain fog is prominent among the most reported neurological symptoms which also include, numbness, tingling, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, and fatigue that last more than a year post-infection.

Vielight Inc. has developed a compact and portable device named the ""Vielight RX Gamma"", which is suitable for home use. The intervention is based on the science of photobiomodulation (PBM) which utilizes certain light energy to modify cellular functions. The fundamental mechanisms of PBM are based on the absorption of photons by the mitochondria to modulate cellular functions. The Vielight Neuro RX Gamma delivers light of specific wavelengths (810 nm), power and duration to the brain/nasal cavity to achieve this. The biological process involves numerous interacting mechanisms that modulate bodily functions. One result of PBM is the benefits it could offer the post COVID-19 (long COVID) population. The Vielight Neuro RX Gamma emitting NIR might reduce inflammatory markers relevant to COVID-19 and since it pulses at 40 Hz can activate the non-inflammatory M2-genotype microglia to remove markers of Alzheimer disease, such as beta-amyloid and possibly tau deposits. Using Vielight Neuro RX Gamma, the same activation of non-inflammatory markers might occur with post COVID-19 (long-COVID) patient population as well as the reduction in the brain fog.

This trial utilizes a completely remote and virtual design. It is a double blind randomized controlled trial that is expected to involve 36 participants who are confirmed to have Post- COVID cognitive impairment. Eighteen of the participants will be randomized to the active Vielight RX Gamma protocol, and the other eighteen participants will be randomized to the sham Vielight RX Gamma regimen.

"Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most commonly used therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TACE is a minimally invasive procedure that involves placing a catheter into the artery in the liver that feeds the tumor, administering chemotherapeutics and then blocking the artery with embolics in order to kill tumor cells by depriving them of essential oxygen and nutrients. While TACE has a proven survival benefit, local recurrence is common, and long-term survival rates are poor. Prior studies demonstrate that HCC cells survive the oxygen and nutrient deprivation through autophagy, a process of cellular self-eating, to provide nutrients required for survival. The proposed project will leverage this dependency to develop a novel approach to TACE that integrates autophagy inhibition to improve therapeutic response by increasing tumor cell killing and enhancing anti-tumor immunity.",Hepatocellular Carcinoma,ALL,PHASE1|PHASE2,"Corporal Michael J.

Dysphagia intervention in the United States involves evaluation at onset of dysphagia symptoms followed by short-term therapy. Traditional therapy relies on verbal instruction and low-tech at-home exercise regimens without visual biofeedback; lacking a monitoring of accuracy or strength of exercise. Available biofeedback is office-based, bulky and expensive, thus, not readily used. The Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) is a well-researched office based biofeedback system that has recently been converted into an affordable and accessible home-based application. This study aims to investigate the impact of swallowing therapy using the BiSSKit app on airway protective outcomes in patients with PD. Thirty participants with PD and dysphagia will be recruited for this study. Participants will undergo a baseline-modified barium swallowing (MBS) evaluation followed by 12 weekly sessions of swallowing therapy. Participants will be randomized to two swallowing therapy groups (1) traditional (2) BiSSKit app. Participants will undergo MBS following therapy completion.

"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a autoimmune disease associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) and premature death, particularly in Black patients. Traditional CAD risk factors like hypertension (HTN) are both very common and poorly controlled among Black RA patients. Disparities in RA disease activity further increase the risk of CAD in this population. Black patients face significant barriers when seeking RA care, and the investigators suspect similar challenges affect HTN care in this population. The goals of this project are to identify and address barriers to HTN care in patients with RA to reduce disparities in HTN and CAD outcomes for Black RA patients.

Interviews with Black RA patients, rheumatology providers, and primary care providers in the Duke University Health System will be conducted to describe barriers to HTN care in Black RA patients. Interviews will focus on access to care, patient-provider communication, coordination of care, and the challenges of managing HTN in patients with RA. These interviews will help us to develop an intervention that will focus on improving uncontrolled HTN in Black RA patients. The investigators plan to do this by empowering Black RA patients to actively participate in their HTN care, improving patient-provider communication, and improving coordination between primary care and rheumatology providers. If successful, our intervention has the potential to reduce rates of CAD and associated death for Black RA patients.",Hypertension|Rheumatoid Arthritis,ALL,NA,"Duke Health System, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States"

"Immune-related colitis from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is a common adverse effect causing significant morbidity and impairment of quality of life (QoL). Steroids are the first line of treatment for severe ICI induced Immune- mediated diarrhea and colitis (IMDC).

However, efficacy data supporting the use of immunosuppressives for steroid refractory IMDC is limited by case reports/series. Clinical trials focusing on steroid-refractory colitis are sparse. Novel treatments for IMDC outside of blanket immunosuppression are needed. There is robust evidence to suggest that gut microbial diversity and composition is associated with both ICI efficacy and toxicity.

"Pregnant women in South Africa (SA) are at high risk of HIV acquisition. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use during pregnancy is both safe and effective in preventing HIV. However, posttraumatic stress (associated with intimate partner violence and/or other traumas) and depression negatively impact PrEP adherence among women in SA. Addressing posttraumatic stress and depression will likely improve PrEP adherence and persistence (i.e., sustained PrEP adherence over time) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which are periods of dramatically increased HIV risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive behavioral intervention that targets common underlying factors of posttraumatic stress and depression to improve PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy and the postpartum transition. The specific aims of the project are to (1) explore the mechanisms by which posttraumatic stress and depression impact PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy via qualitative interviews; (2) develop a brief PrEP adherence and persistence intervention (\~4 sessions) that reduces the negative impact of psychological mechanisms common to posttraumatic stress and depression on PrEP use, and builds behavioral skills to improve self-care; and (3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and signals of preliminary efficacy of the intervention, which will be integrated into antenatal care, in a pilot randomized controlled trial.

"Of the 1.8 million females with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in the US, over half of those who are premenopausal suffer from cyclical menstrual-related IBD symptoms, regardless of how well their disease is controlled. Despite the significant impact that cyclical IBD symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue have on quality of life, evidence about how to alleviate these symptoms is lacking. In other chronic conditions which are hormonally influenced, such as epilepsy, hormonal contraception may be used to favorably impact disease-related symptoms associated with menses and improve quality of life. In our previous cross-sectional study, 47% of the levonorgestrel intrauterine device users and 19% of combination oral contraceptive users reported improvement in their cyclical IBD symptom. All hormonal methods may plausibly improve symptoms, but prospective, rigorous data evaluating their efficacy for this purpose are lacking. In order to design a future comparative effectiveness trial on the effect of hormonal contraceptive methods on menstrual-related IBD symptoms, we propose this pilot prospective cohort study of 200 females with IBD: 100 naturally cycling and 100 hormonal contraception users. We will gain essential knowledge on IBD-specific influences on contraceptive method selection, willingness to be randomized to methods, the ability of IBD patient reported outcome (PRO) instruments to differentiate between non-menstrual and menstrual-related IBD symptoms, and assess the potential role of inflammatory markers as outcome measures in future trials. We will recruit participants from the University of Utah IBD Center and clinics, other Utah gastroenterology providers, and through social media ads. Total study commitment will be \~12 weeks. Study activities will include daily and weekly text message surveys, as well as blood draws and fecal samples for inflammatory markers in a subset of participants which are commonly used for IBD management.

This pilot will inform a future trial design to define non-contraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception on cyclical IBD symptoms.

Understanding the mechanisms of action of GLED will provide additional support for using light therapy as both a treatment and as a possible diagnostic tool. While investigators do not fully understand the mechanisms of action of GLED, investigators do know that it is centrally mediated.

To better elucidate the mechanism of action for GLED, investigators propose a single-blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to elucidate the central mechanism(s) of action that GLED therapy has in improving fibromyalgia pain, conducted by a team with a successful record of collaboration.

"Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is more commonly seen in individual's post-spinal cord injury (SCI) than in the general population. Depression post-SCI impacts an individuals' quality of life and recovery. It has been reported that among Veterans with an SCI, those without depression live longer than those with depression. Thus, depression must be treated appropriately. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA-approved treatment for depression, but dosing is based on a motor response or movement in the thumb. Over half of individuals with SCI have some degree of arm or hand impairment, so these individuals might not be eligible for rTMS, or they may receive the wrong dose. This study proposes clinical trial in individuals with depression post-SCI to assess the anti-depressant effect of a novel technique to dose rTMS that does not require a motor response in the thumb. By gaining a better understanding of the application of rTMS for depression post-SCI, the investigators aim to advance the rehabilitative care of Veterans.","Spinal Cord Injuries|Depression|Depressive Disorder, Major",ALL,NA,"Ralph H.

In the egalitarian system that is the VHA the treatment of prostate cancer is excellent, uniform across the US and indifferent to race. The choices made are clearly personalized, given not all men received all therapies and that younger Veterans were treated more aggressively.

But with survivals that rival those in registration trials that enroll optimally fit individuals usually not encumbered by the co-morbidities that afflict many Veterans, the outcomes are testimony to the fact that for this common malady of older Veterans with whom VA physicians have broad experience the care administered is unsurpassed.

"Traditional strategies for diagnosing psychiatric disorders focus on definitions based on constellations of co-occurring symptoms. Tracking symptom severity across therapy arcs relies on administering scales that again ask questions about symptoms. These strategies have allowed some degree of standardization but suffer from having a phenomenological rather than mechanistic foundation (in terms of diagnosis) as well as subjectivity and temporal sparseness (in terms of measurement). We apply a transdiagnostic framework based on the neurobiological concept of approach behavior. Several psychiatric disorders (including OCD, uni- and bipolar depression, PTSD and anxiety disorders, and addiction disorders) are characterized by dysfunction in approach behavior. We study the neurobehavioral basis of approach dysfunction in a cohort of individuals with severe OCD and bipolar disorder (BD). To study these behaviors, we deploy a suite of wearables and peripherals (Oura ring, Apple Watch, iPhone, audioband) that allow continuous and dense measurement of behaviors relevant to our approach hypothesis: socialization, activity, and sleep patterns. We perform these measurements in two selected environments. One is a novel apartment-style setting (neurobehavioral unit, NBU) that combines the high-bandwidth data acquisition capability of a lab with the naturalistic relevance and comfort of the home. The second is the truly natural and maximally ethologically relevant setting of the ambulatory ""home"" environment in which people spend the majority of their time. The participants will be individuals planned for deep brain stimulation (DBS) implant for their OCD or BD. The bi-directional (stimulate as well as record) nature of the DBS systems will allow neural recordings that we will synchronize with the behavioral data streams.

"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common benign neoplasm in men. Almost 90% of men in their 70s report lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH. These symptoms carry a significant negative impact on the patients' quality of life.

Despite the wide availability of surgical offerings to relieve bladder outlet obstruction such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP), and prostatectomy, many patients still suffer from persistent LUTS after undergoing these. A study describing postoperative outcomes following HoLEP revealed that patients with severe lower urinary tract symptoms, storage-positive sub-score, and high maximum urinary flow rate before the surgery were affected by a rebound of mainly storage symptoms 6-8 weeks after HoLEP and prolonged recovery from LUTS with 7.4% of them presenting for persistent urge complaints.

Optimizing the management approach for these patients has been limited by lack of high level evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus. Intravesical botox injections are well-established therapeutic options for several urinary disorders. The current practice offers intravesical botox injections to patients who suffer from persistent urinary symptoms few months after their BPH procedure. This study aims to evaluate if giving botox injections at the time of the HoLEP surgery would yield a better outcome than performing the two procedures separately at different times (few months apart).

The concomitant use of botox injection during bladder de-obstructing procedures has been previously studied in TURP and have showed a significant reduction of incontinence episodes and OAB symptoms in the group that were treated with botox injections after 36 weeks post TURP. This data may suggest promising potential of this intervention in managing persistent OAB symptoms in patients with BOO. However, the efficacy of combining HoLEP and bladder Botox injections has not been systematically studied and evaluated.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of intravesical Botox injections on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) when administered during HoLEP surgery in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and overactive bladder symptoms (OAB). The investigators are interested in comparing the postoperative outcome in terms of recovery and symptom relief in patients who performed HoLEP surgery with bladder Botox injections versus those who performed HoLEP surgery only at 2 weeks,1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively.

"The investigators are testing the hypothesis that lower pressure pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic large bowel surgery protects the bowel from postoperative ileus and bowel dysfunction leading to faster recovery and discharge from the hospital. Our study will focus on the effects of high or low intraperitoneal pressure as well as pressure variations on the course of postoperative ileus, time to hospital discharge, and postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction in adult patients undergoing laparoscopic large bowel resection (i.e., sigmoidectomy and right colectomy). A randomized parallel group study will be conducted involving 5 arms of surgical patients to test whether differences on postoperative ileus outcome parameters occur between high (15 mm Hg) and low pressure pneumoperitoneum (8-12 mm Hg), as well as whether there are differences between the 2 insufflation devices that provide constant or variable intrabdominal pressure throughout the laparoscopic surgery. For high pressure pneumoperitoneum, either neostigmine or sugammadex are used for reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade. For low pressure pneumoperitoneum, sugammadex is used for reversal of deep neuromuscular blockade. The investigators plan to use 2 types of gas insufflation devices, one of which will provide a relatively stable pressure level throughout surgery (AirSealÂ® device), and the second one will provide a more variable pressure (Olympus standard insufflation device). Using both pressure modalities, the investigators will study the effects of different pressure characteristics on the course of postoperative ileus, duration of in-hospital treatment, pain level, and the stability of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters during surgery. Changes in intrabdominal pressure during the surgery will be monitored and recorded using a custom software for later analysis of fluctuations in pressure to relate them to outcomes.

"In evaluating a patient's ability to have a normal vaginal delivery, a practitioner must consider three factors. Commonly referred to as the three P's, these include Power (contractions), Passage (pelvis and soft tissue) and passenger (baby). Power can be controlled through induction and augmentation agents. Passage is determined by the women's body habitus. Passenger includes the baby's estimated fetal weight (EFW) and position. Throughout the history of obstetrics, the baby's position has been a factor that has acted as a strong predictor of a woman's ability to deliver vaginally. Several researchers have looked into the percentage of babies born in the Occiput Anterior (fetus facing down) vs. Occiput Posterior (fetus facing up aka ""sunny side up"") position. Studies have shown that the majority of babies are born in OA position and that the finding of an OA positioned baby is associated with a greater likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery. OP position is associated with higher risk of 3rd and 4th degree perineal lacerations, operative delivery (vacuum/forceps) and cesarean section. Therefore OP position poses a higher risk of morbidity to the patient and fetus. Multiple studies exist in the obstetrics and midwifery literature regarding maternal positioning to correct fetal malposition. Many of these studies have shown no significance and those that do have generated conflicting results and are consistently lacking in power. The aim of this prospective study is to determine if maternal positioning to either the side of fetal movement (contralateral/opposite to the fetal spine) or opposite of the side of fetal movement (ipsilateral to the fetal spine) during the first stage of labor is associated with correction of fetal OP to OA position. Upon admission to labor and delivery, following an initial ultrasound to confirm fetal OP position, women in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups; one control (Group A), and two experimental (Groups B and C) groups. Those assigned to Group A will be allowed to remain in any position they chose during their labor and delivery course. Group B will be placed in a dorsal recumbent, modified sims position on the side of fetal movement. Group C, will be placed in the same position but opposite that of which fetal kicks are felt. Subjects in the experimental group will be asked to remain in these positions throughout the majority of their labor and delivery course, up until the second stage of labor (10 cm dilated). They will be allowed to change positions for up to 10 min per hour for maternal comfort and any fetal resuscitation efforts. Anything longer than this will be considered a deviation from the protocol and will be documented as such, but all necessary intervention for fetal well-being will be allowed including changes in maternal position for longer than 10 minutes. Once a cervical dilation of 10cm is achieved all study interventions will be discontinued. Peanut balls and manual rotational maneuvers will not be allowed as they are considered confounding factors which may individually affect fetal position. Data will be collected from the hospital record. This data will include: maternal age, BMI, race, maternal medical complications, delivery type, laceration, fetal position at delivery, dilation on admission and weight of the baby.",Obstetric Complication,FEMALE,NA,"Long Island Jewish medical center, New Hyde Park, New York, 11040, United States"

To reach this aim, it delivers single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to one or two brain areas at a time while electroencephalography (EEG) is measured. When only one brain area is stimulated (uni-focal TMS), the goal is to record how many milliseconds it takes for the activity to spread from the stimulated area to other brain regions (conduction delay). When two brain areas are stimulated (bi-focal TMS), the TMS pulses are separated by a short millisecond-level time interval (""asynchrony"") in a so-called paired associative stimulation (PAS) design. The central hypothesis is that PAS may increase or decrease connectivity between the stimulated areas depending on the asynchrony value.

"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a treatable and common condition encountered in the emergency department, but unfortunately is rarely directly addressed in emergency departments nationwide. To our knowledge, initiation of medication assisted therapy (MAT) for AUD in the emergency department setting has not been widely adopted. Our project is novel for its scope to use a medication well-tested in the outpatient environment and bring it to the emergency department in order to more effectively link patients to outpatient alcohol use reduction therapy as part of a medication assisted therapy (MAT). The investigators are proposing a feasibility project to initiate oral naltrexone to eligible ED patients deemed to have alcohol use disorder and who are interested in cutting down their drinking. The investigators plan to connect these patients with outpatient follow-up in our own community practice center (CPC) for intramuscular (IM) Vivitrol injections under the supervision of the Einstein Toxicology Department. Through the CPC, patients can also be referred to other supporting services such as Alcoholics Anonymous for multidisciplinary care. The investigators are optimistic that this innovative warm hand off from the initial ED visit to outpatient follow-up will ultimately decrease problematic drinking, improve patient's health, and benefit the hospital.

Our main objective is to establish a pathway to encourage patients who present to the emergency room with acute sequelae of alcohol use disorder to enter outpatient treatment. Our intervention will be the initiation of oral naltrexone with warm handoff to the Community Practice Center where patients will be transitioned to intramuscular (IM) Vivitrol for chronic maintenance therapy.

"Mechanisms that drive addiction to sugar rich foods are a major driving factor in the pathogenesis of obesity, which has become one of the most significant health care burdens. The molecular underpinnings of these hedonic mechanisms that drive addiction to sugar are poorly understood. The investigators demonstrated that methylglyoxal (MGO) derived Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) enhance food intake especially under a high sugar diet. The investigators identified a methylglyoxal (MGO) lowering cocktail, Gly-low, a combination of alpha-lipoic acid, nicotinamide, thiamine, pyridoxamine, and piperine that demonstrates a multimodal effect influencing many pathways related to aging including calorie restriction. Glycation lowering (Gly-low) treatment significantly reduces food intake and weight gain in the db/db mice that lack the leptin receptor. The investigators also extended the lifespan of C57BL/6 mice fed with these compounds starting when they were 24 months old.

"Cystinuria is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of the kidney that is the result of an inability to reabsorb dibasic amino acids, including cystine, from the urine. Supersaturation of cystine in the urine produces crystals that precipitate and form stones in the kidney, which can be a cause of obstruction, infection, and chronic kidney disease. Cystine stones constitute a major health challenge for affected individuals with cystinuria because of the frequent recurrence of painful symptoms and the current absence of effective, patient-accepting treatment.

A mainstay of therapy is breaking or preventing the cystine bond on the molecular level such that cystine (which is formed from the joining of two cysteine amino acids and their corresponding sulfur atoms) cannot precipitate in the urine. It is hypothesized that a glucose molecule may be able to do this if introduced into the urine. SGLT-2 inhibitors are a class of drug that are FDA approved to treat diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure by inhibiting an enzyme in the kidney that allows for reabsorption of glucose from the urine. This effectively increases the concentration of glucose in the urine. The hypothesis suggests that administration of this drug to patients with cystinuria will introduce sufficient glucose into the urine to prevent or reverse the formation of cystine stones. To date, there has been no published data on the effectiveness of this therapy for this indication, although the dosage and administration would be identical to that already approved by the FDA for the treatment of DM and heart failure.",Cystinuria,ALL,PHASE2,"University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States"

"Multiparametric MRI of the prostate (mpMRI) plays an integral role in contemporary prostate cancer management. It involves the acquisition of both anatomical sequences (T1- and T2-weighted images) as well as 'functional' imaging sequences (diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging), the latter sequences being those which image water diffusivity and tissue perfusion, respectively. Advantages of mpMRI include ability to risk stratify patients prior to biopsy, enhanced detection of clinically significant cancer and reduced diagnosis of insignificant cancers, the identification of active surveillance candidates and improved local staging for subsequent surgical and radiotherapy planning. However, there are ongoing challenges encountered with prostate mpMRI in terms of patient acceptance, image acquisition technical challenges, interpretive expertise and cost.

These challenges have motivated recent investigations employing tailored MRI protocols, i.e. faster and less expensive MR exams that eliminate one or more aspects of current mpMRI technique considered redundant, while retaining the essential imaging parameters needed for equivalent diagnostic interpretation. Among these is non-contrast biparametric MRI, which involves anatomic T2 weighted images along with diffusion weighted images (DWI) as the only retained functional sequence. Both single center studies and meta analyses have demonstrated no added value for DCE compared to the combination of T2WI and DWI, Overall cancer detection rates have been found to be equivalent for bpMRI compared to mpMRI, independent of reader experience, with comparable efficacy to guide cognitive targeted, MRI-targeted and MRI-US fusion guided biopsy. Equivalence between bpMRI and mpMRI for cancer detection has also been corroborated in two recently published meta analyses. Based upon our institution's experience with prostate mpMRI, avoidance of gadolinium and DCE imaging would be associated with a 30 percent reduction in scan cost and 40 percent reduction in total time (i.e. scan time plus patient preparatory time).",Prostate Cancer,ALL,PHASE2,"M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States"

The population with chronic illness as stated: PTSD, Chronic Depression, MS, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2- Long Haulers Syndrome. These chronic conditions/illnesses many lead to death and are often the cause or perpetuate unregulated trauma and create an unstable population. Psychiatrists have testified before congress that the SSSRI medications are not fully functional cures and are not working for patients. Enchanced Psilocybin micro-dosing at the levels of 0.15g. ranging to 0.33g. every other day an 0.50g. for monthly maintenance of neural pathway production is proving to shave back the highjacked nervous system, thus stopping or rerouting the ruminating neurotransmitters, by rerouting thru new neural pathways. The body has a additional natural pathway in place then to decrease/stop these thoughts by have open pathways to process the thought differently. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter and which is the most famous of all the neurotransmitters. Serotonin is very similar in its compound structure to the plant medicine family of psilocybin, serotonin and psilocybin work very similarly with the 5h2A receptor in the human cortex ( the outer cortex of the brain ). Enhanced Microdosing of psilocybin at the levels of 0.15 to 0.33 and of 1 gram to 1.5 grams monthly for maintenance of the newly opened neural pathways is postulated to be a mental health game changer.

"Alcohol misuse and related risky sexual behaviors are significant health concerns for college students. Two-thirds of students are current drinkers, at least 1 in 3 report past month heavy episodic drinking (5+ drinks in a row), and 1 in 10 report high intensity drinking (10+ drinks in a row). Increased student alcohol use and heavy drinking are linked to increased sexual activity and related risky behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, sex with casual partners). This puts students at risk for negative health outcomes (e.g., STIs - sexually transmitted infections) and is also a pathway to sexual victimization and escalated drinking. The first few weeks of college, known as the 'red zone,' provide an opportunity to intervene at time when these behaviors increase. However, most prevention programs for college students tend to focus on student alcohol use and have little to no integration of content on the relationship between alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. This is an important gap in the literature and a priority area for NIAAA. The research team established the short-term efficacy of a personalized feedback intervention (PFI), a gold standard intervention approach, with integrated content on alcohol and risky sexual behaviors. In this study, we propose to extend our integrated PFI to include a cross-tailored dynamic feedback (CDF) component. The CDF component will use technology to incorporate daily assessments of student behavior and provide students with dynamic weekly feedback over 12 weeks.

"This is a single site, randomized single blinded, two arm study researching the effects of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) versus Triamcinolone in patients with hip osteoarthritis. The aims and hypothesis are as follows:

Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the change in pain and functional scores of a single bone marrow aspirate injection in comparison to triamcinolone in patients with hip osteoarthritis through validated patient reported outcomes scores at baseline to 12 months (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that triamcinolone and BMAC groups will have pain reduction after each respective intervention. The changes with triamcinolone will be noticeable on the short term. The BMAC changes will take longer to have an effect but will longer duration. The investigators hypothesize that at 6 months and 1 year participants receiving BMAC will have better scores reported on the WOMAC compared to the triamcinolone injection and better than prior to injection.

Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the change of bone marrow aspirate injection in comparison to triamcinolone in participant's performance on the 6 minute walk test from baseline to 12 months (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be higher walking distances on the 6 minute walk test in the participants receiving a BMAC injection in comparison to triamcinolone starting at the 3 months follow-up time.

Specific Aim 3: Quantify and correlate cell characterization with patient reported outcomes score.

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be better patient reported outcomes in patients who have a higher concentration of mesenchymal stem cells injected.

"Transthyretin is a protein produced in the liver that transports thyroid hormone and vitamin A. A single substitution of an amino acid in the structure of TTR can result in a relatively unstable protein, the breakdown products of which (predominantly monomers) aggregate abnormally and produce proteinaceous deposits in nerves and the heart. These deposits are known as amyloid and produce progressive nerve and heart damage. Amyloidosis due to a mutant TTR is usually an autosomal dominant and hence is a familial condition. Wild-type TTR is also capable of producing amyloid deposits which predominantly involves the heart (rather than the nervous system) resulting in a progressive decrease in cardiac function with increasing signs of heart failure. This study aims to determine whether subcutaneous injection of an antisense oligonucleotide drug, known as ION-682884, that has been specifically designed to reduce production of the protein transthyretin by the liver, can slow or stop the progression of TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy as compared to historical controls, using advanced echocardiography and cardiac MRI. This study drug will only be administered to patients who have completed a 24-month study of a similar drug, inotersen (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT037028289).The study also aims to determine the tolerability and safety of this drug when administered over a 36+-month period to patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy.

"Misplacement of endotracheal tube (ETT) can have devastating complications for patients, some of which include respiratory failure, atelectasis, and pneumothorax.

There are a number of ways to verify the correct placement of ETT, with the stethoscope auscultation being commonly used despite its low accuracy (60-65%) in distinguishing tracheal from bronchial intubation (4-6). The gold standard techniques include Chest X Ray or fiberoptic bronchoscope (7-8), with a recent study showing point-of-care ultrasound. However, these techniques are expensive, time-consuming, often not readily available and require substantial training before users can reliably utilize them. Given intubation is often performed in urgent clinical settings, a technique that can reliably yet efficiently localize ETT would be beneficial.

"Hypertension affects 1 in every 3 adults in the US and contributes to 410,000 deaths annually. Hypertension and its associated complications disproportionately affect minority populations living in urban areas. In Chicago, health status indicators show worsening disparities between black and white residents, with the highest rates of hypertension, heart disease, and stroke clustering in the predominantly black South and West Sides. Kaiser Permanente demonstrated that a bundle of evidence-based interventions implemented within a large, integrated health system in Northern California significantly increased blood pressure control rates. However, it is unclear whether a health system centered intervention can be adapted to other settings, particularly under-resourced urban communities. Therefore, the overall goal is to support a community-centered design and adaptation of the Kaiser bundle. The investigative team will adapt the delivery model of the Kaiser bundle to be centered within churches within the South Side of Chicago, one of the most medically underserved communities in the United States. The proposed interventions are the same as in the Kaiser bundle (e.g., registry/audit and feedback, simplified treatment regimens, accurate Blood Pressure measurement) but implementation of the components of the bundle will be adapted for delivery in the community. The intervention will be carried out by local community health workers and ministry facilitators, with health clinics and hospitals in the community as support, all connected through a common data platform.

Thus, the proposed project will identify the best strategies to support adoption, implementation with fidelity, and sustainability of the Kaiser bundle in the community setting. The proposed study will follow the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) process model and implementation is rigorously evaluated using a multimethod approach to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (REAIM) evaluation framework.

"Recently in 2016, a new interfascial plane nerve block was developed for thoracic analgesia known as the erector spinae plane block (ESPB). Since its development for thoracic neuropathic pain, the ESPB has been shown to be effective in pain control in multiple procedures including thoracotomies. However, there have been a few published case reports of using ESPB for analgesia in rib fracture management and only one retrospective study which demonstrated improved NRS pain scores and increased incentive spirometry volumes (ICV) post-ESPB compared to pre-ESPB values.

The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of ESPB as an alternative method to the current standard of care at Stanford Health Care (SHC) for pain management in traumatic rib fractures. At the investigator's institution, the current standard of care is intravenous (IV) and enteral multimodal analgesia that consists primarily of opioids and a continuous IV lidocaine infusion. Although IV lidocaine has shown some benefit in improving post-surgical pain scores, evidence for its use in MRF is lacking. The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized clinical trial comparing outcomes in pain control and incentive spirometry volumes between continuous ESPB catheters and IV lidocaine infusions in adult patients with acute traumatic rib fractures.

The investigators want to determine if ESPB can provide improved pain control in patients admitted for traumatic rib fractures compared to IV Lidocaine. The aim is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of ESPB on OME consumption, pain scores, incentive spirometry volumes, cough strength, respiratory complications, inflammatory biomarkers and hospital LOS. Findings from this study can help improve analgesia, quality of care, and patient satisfaction at Stanford Healthcare and for other acute pain and trauma surgery providers.

"Sickle cell crisis continues to be a frequent presentation to emergency departments. Patients presenting will often require immediate treatment for their pain and often times this will include opioids. The opioid epidemic has cost thousands of lives; and continues to be a significant problem posing several challenges when treating patients presenting with sickle cell disease. Primarily, opioids remain the mainstay of treatment for these patients and the push to address the opioid crisis may present challenges for adequate opioid administration in patients suffering from a sickle cell crisis while hospitals find ways to curb the opioid crisis overall. Opioid treatment for patients in acute vaso-occlusive crisis has significantly contributed to quality of life and life expectancy of patients with this diagnosis. Measures should continue to attempt to administer a multi-model approach to sickle cell patients to minimize the morphine milligram equivalents in these patients while also successfully addressing the patient's pain. IV lidocaine is a pain medication that has been evaluated in several painful experiences, such as in renal colic. A few case reports have shown IV lidocaine use in sickle cell can be a potential effective adjunct medication to opioids to treat pain and reduce further opioid requirements. Currently, no prospective controlled trial exists to evaluate the true benefit of IV lidocaine in this population.

"Today, prosthetic hands are numb. They provide no tactile or proprioceptive sensory information back to the user. The lack of sensory feedback has been shown to reduce the utility of a prosthesis by half. The prosthesis is seen as a tool, not as an incorporated part of the body schema. Only now are there chronically-implantable technologies which can provide physiologically appropriate sensory feedback to upper limb amputees to recreate tactile and proprioceptive percepts. These sensations are the building blocks to enable the embodiment of the device. Furthermore, newly developed outcome measures are now available which can detail the improved embodiment such neural interfaces can create. The investigator's mission is to enable the embodiment of artificial devices using peripheral nerve stimulation and thereby close the gap between the experience of our intact physiological systems and those using prosthetic remedies.

This investigation of embodiment for upper limb amputees is organized into three main areas of work including 1) normative data collection, 2) device development, and 3) characterization of embodiment using peripheral nerve stimulation. The normative data collection will quantify the embodiment of conventional cosmetic, body-powered, and myoelectric prosthetic hand options using a modified Rubber Hand Illusion protocol (Specific Aim 1). This thrust will ask how does the amount of embodiment vary among conventional prosthetic hands as well as probe the relationship between agency and embodiment. The device development project entails the design of multi-modal sensors in order to study full-hand embodiment (Specific Aim 2). The ability to measure and then elicit sensation on the passive surfaces of the hand (palm, ulnar border, and dorsal surface) has never been explored.

"Background:

Cushing s disease is caused by a pituitary gland tumor. Patients with Cushing s disease suffer obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, weakness, and hypertension. The cure is surgery to remove the pituitary tumor. Currently, MRI is the best way to find these tumors. But not all tumors can be seen with an MRI. Researchers hope giving the hormone CRH before a PET scan can help make these tumors more visible.

Objective:

To test whether giving CRH before a PET scan will help find pituitary gland tumors that might be causing Cushing s disease.

Eligibility:

People ages 8 and older with Cushing s disease that is caused by a pituitary gland tumor that cannot be reliably seen on MRI

Design:

Participants will be screened with their medical history, a physical exam, an MRI, and blood tests.

Participants will have at least one hospital visit. During their time in the hospital, they will have a physical exam and a neurological exam. They will have a PET scan of the brain. A thin plastic tube will be inserted into an arm vein. A small amount of radioactive sugar and CRH will be injected through the tube. Participants will lie in a darkened room for about an hour and be asked to urinate. Then they will lie inside the scanner for about 40 minutes. After the scan, they will be asked to urinate every 2-3 hours for the rest of the day. Blood will be drawn through a needle in the arm.

Participants will have surgery to remove their tumor within 3 months after the scan.

Participants will then continue regular follow-up in the clinic.",Cushing's Disease|Pituitary Adenoma,ALL,NA,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

"Reducing opioid prescription related use and misuse is a major focus for countering the national epidemic of opioid overdose and death. Annually, over 3.5 million predominantly young and healthy individuals undergo outpatient third molar ('wisdom tooth') tooth extractions under sedation and routinely receive postoperative opioid prescriptions. This procedure is among the most prevalent instances of opioid prescriptions dispensed to adolescents, a vulnerable population. This overuse can be minimized by bringing about immediate and sustained pain relief following extractions and by proper monitoring to regulate post-operative opioid usage.

The investigators developed the Twin block, a local anesthetic nerve block that rapidly eases pain from the 'closer' muscles of the jaw and showed its long-term effectiveness in patients with chronic jaw muscle pain. Administering the Twin block immediately following third molar extractions will be an innovative and effective modality to alleviate acute post-procedure pain experienced by the patient and hence reduce the need for post-operative opioid pain medication.

In order to tightly regulate when, how many and to whom the prescribed opioid pill is accessible, this study will utilize the iPill DispenserÂ®, an active pill dispenser. The iPill device, designated as a Class I 510(k) exempt device by the FDA, includes an App that utilizes biometric user authentication to operate a portable tamper-resistant, pre-calibrated device to regulate, deliver, and monitor opioid usage for pain, preventing overconsumption and diversion. The investigators further plan to 'track' pill swallowing by encapsulating the medication with an ingestible event marker (IEMs, FDA approved Class II device). The hypothesis of this study is that reduction in opioid prescription and its unwarranted use following third molar extractions can be achieved by a combination of Twin block, an active pill dispenser and ingestion tracking. The Specific Aims are:

Specific Aim 1. Compare highest pain after third molar tooth extractions, in patients with and without the twin block.

Specific Aim 2. Compare postoperative opioid consumption during the first 4 days following third molar tooth extractions between patients who got the twin block, with those who do not. Using the iPill dispenser and app and the IEM, the investigators will track opioid consumption for severe pain.","Pain, Postoperative",ALL,PHASE2,"Rutgers Health University Dental Associates, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 08901, United States"
"Black and White mothers have similar prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However Black mothers are more likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) after a diagnosis of GDM. Both GDM and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increase her cardiovascular risk. The post-partum period is an ideal time to employ preventative strategies to alter her lifetime health-course. Unfortunately, Black mothers are less likely to follow up post-partum and less likely to be informed of the connection between pregnancy complications such as GDM and cardiovascular risks.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is the ""gold standard"" for lifestyle intervention to prevent T2DM in at risk patients. From the original trial of over 1,000 racially heterogenous participants, the DPP underperformed in Black women and can be improved upon. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial entitled: Mobilizing doulas to empower black women in post-partum diabetes prevention. This program will follow the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) curriculum as outlined by the CDC using an online platform. However, this program will expand on the DPP's educational program and provide trained community-based health care workers i.e., ""doulas divas"" to administer post-partum support while the participants matriculate through the online DPP. Participants will be randomized to either DPP only for one year or DPP + doula divas for one year).

The investigators hypothesize that for Black participants with GDM, DPP+ doula divas program will have a completion rate superior to that of the DPP alone.

The investigators propose this randomized controlled clinical trial utilizing institution and community partnerships to increase the rates of completion of post-partum diabetes prevention program in at risk women: Black women with GDM. The investigators also will implement this culturally responsive approach with the goal of reducing T2DM in Black women.

"Temporary mechanical circulatory support devices are increasingly used for short-term support in patients with decompensated cardiogenic shock. Recently, a new axial flow pump has become widely available with the Impella System. The Impella has been FDA approved for short term usage. Hemolysis, however, has been a common complication that has increased morbidity and mortality in this patient population.

It is hypothesized that a major source of hemolysis in this patient population is shear stress experienced by red blood cells (RBC) as they travel through the pump device. In addition to causing RBC loss and potential anemia, the hemolysis has multiple other downstream consequences including creation of a pro-thrombotic environment leading to clot formation and potential device failure and secondary end organ dysfunction (renal and liver failure). Due to the significant effects of hemolysis in this population, a great deal of interest has been recently focused on addressing this problem, but as of yet no durable solutions exist.

Pentoxifylline improves red blood cell deformability and reduces blood viscosity. It is hypothesized here that administering Pentoxifylline to patients in CS who require temporary MCS will decrease the amount of shear stress related hemolysis through the improved deformability and durability of RBCs. We propose to perform a double-blinded randomized controlled trial in patients who undergo an axillary Impella 5.0 insertion for acute decompensated heart failure. There will be a control group who receives a placebo and the treatment group who receives pentoxifylline.

"Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) causes chronic cough, throat clearing, hoarseness, and dysphagia and if left untreated can promote the development of laryngeal cancer. More than 20% of the United Stated population suffer from LPR, yet there is no effective medical therapy. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which inhibit gastric acid production but do not prevent reflux events, continue to be prescribed for LPR despite their poor efficacy for this patient population, high cost ($26 billion/year), and associated risks. Pepsin, detected in the airway of these patients and now known to cause laryngeal inflammation and promote disease independent of gastric acid, is a key therapeutic target. We report preclinical studies of select HIV inhibitors that bind to and inhibit pepsin and thus hold promise for the treatment of LPR. In support, a very low incidence of LPR was found in patients taking these drugs compared to the general population. HIV inhibitors are ideal drugs to repurpose because they target a foreign virus. Thus, a repurposing approach can be used to safely perform proof of concept testing of the efficacy of a pepsin inhibitor for LPR. The Specific Aim of this project is to perform a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of fosamprenavir-sodium alginate(FOS-SA) for LPR. FOS-SA will be used at the FDA approved, manufacturers recommended dose for HIV for 12 weeks in medically refractory patients with clinically diagnosed moderate/severe LPR and combined multi-channel intraluminal impedance - pH (MII-pH) confirmed laryngeal reflux events.

"BehÃ§et's Disease (BD) is a complex, chronic, relapsing, multi-system inflammatory disorder that is characterized by oral ulcers, genital ulcers in addition to ocular and skin symptoms. Genital ulcers are the second most common symptom of BD and occur in 57-93% of BD patients. The genital ulcers of BD clearly cause considerable morbidity for those affected. This will be one of the first trials of a topical product designed for accelerated healing of BD genital ulcers. There is no cure or FDA-approved therapies for BD genital ulcers and the treatment of recurrent genital ulcers that are associated with BD is palliative.

Recent study evaluating the effect of topical PTX on BD oral ulcers suggests that topical pentoxifylline (PTX) might have an immediate impact on BD oral ulcer healing leading to accelerated ulcer clearance, which results in lower daily ulcer numbers for the patients along with reduced pain scores. Investigators hypothesize that application of topical PTX will accelerate the healing of BD genital ulcers in a similar clinically meaningful way, and further hypothesize that topical PTX can become a valuable adjunct to any other systemic therapy for BD.",Behcet Syndrome|Behcet Disease,ALL,PHASE2,"Silk Road Therapies, Washington, District of Columbia, 20008, United States"

"Sugammadex was approved for post-operative use in the operating room (OR) and post-anesthesia recovery unit (PACU) of our quaternary facility, Tampa General Hospital.

"Colonoscopy is a common endoscopic procedure which the UVA Gastroenterology \& Hepatology department performs on a daily basis for both screening/surveillance and diagnostic/therapeutic intent. As a safety net hospital, the institution also offers open access colonoscopy as a means of allowing outside primary care and urgent care providers a way to have patients receive necessary endoscopy services. However, these patients are not all seen in clinic prior to their procedure but are all prescribed a specific bowel prep by a medical professional who screens the referrals.

Given that the patient population described above are often not well-known to UVA providers, they may be prescribed prep regimens that are not ideal for their comorbidities. Not infrequently, these patients show up to their colonoscopies with an inadequate bowel prep, leading to either cancelled or incomplete procedures, increased healthcare and personal financial costs (such as missed wages from taking off work), suboptimal endoscopy resource utilization, and delay in or missed polyp (or potentially cancer) detection.

The investigators seek to use a novel scoring system designed to predict patients at risk for suboptimal preps (and hence patients that would benefit from an extended prep) and apply it in uniform fashion to a patient population most at risk for suboptimal preps. Because obtaining written consent is not practical given that these patients may not be seen by a UVA provider prior to their endoscopic procedure, the investigators will plan to verbally consent via the telephone in an all-inclusive manner; there will be no randomization but rather the selection of prep to be determined by the novel scoring system. Subjects be prescribed either a standard split-dose GoLytely prep (or SuPrep) or an extended split-dose GoLytely prep. The investigators predict that utilizing this new system will lead to a decreased number of inadequate bowel preps and will increase polyp detection.

"Primary Objectives:

Mindsets have been rigorously studied in the domains of development, education, and more recently, in health and disease. However, there are no large-scale longitudinal studies of the mindsets held by cancer patients and how they may affect treatment outcomes, physical health, and psychological well-being. This randomized, single-blind, treatment-as-usual (TAU) control study aims to assess (1) mindsets at four time points spanning from the point of diagnosis to six weeks post-treatment to patients who are newly diagnosed with cancer and undergoing treatment with curative intent, and (2) the impact of a brief but targeted mindset intervention to help instill more useful mindsets about the nature of cancer and the role of the body on patient reported measures of physical and psychological health. This study aims to add to the existing literature on psychosocial interventions for cancer patients and survivors while addressing the substantial time and cost limitations of traditional interventions. It also contributes to the body of research indicating that mindsets play an important role in both health and wellbeing.

Secondary Objectives:

This study has two secondary objectives. First, we aim to determine the impact of patient mindsets on measures of treatment (treatment efficacy and treatment related adverse events) and psychosocial health (stress, coping, mood, emotions). Second, we aim to understand the relationship between patient mindsets and biomarkers of immune and inflammatory processes in patients undergoing cancer treatment",Cancer,ALL,NA,"Stanford University, Stanford, California, 94304, United States"

"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasingly recognized to have seizures in addition to cognitive decline. Seizures may contribute to memory problems as well as other symptoms common in AD like agitation, depression, or apathy. These symptoms are collectively called neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Studies of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with AD have suggested that injury to certain parts of the brain can cause these neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Based on this evidence, the investigators hypothesize that seizures can also cause neuro-psychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and may be related to the injury seen on MRI.

The current study will follow participants for 1 year and will involve participants with AD who also have neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Participants will be examined with three brain wave studies to assess for seizure-like activity. Participants with seizure-like activity will all receive levetiracetam for 1 year.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become the leading fatal infectious disease in the United States. Approximately 75% of individuals who have been infected with HCV are chronically infected with the virus. Untreated chronic infection will lead to severe sequelae such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Even though the availability of rapid HCV antibody (HCV Ab) screening assay and highly effective antiviral treatment, most people infected with HCV are not aware of the infection status. This gap mainly comes from the current gold standard confirmatory testing for chronic HCV infection, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based HCV RNA viral load assay which requires an experienced trained laboratory technician to perform relatively complicated PCR assay with a turn-around-time of 1 to 2 days (from provider's order to the test resulting). The investigators' rapid HCV Screening and Linkage to Care program has demonstrated that many patients in the investigators' emergency department (ED) are unaware of patient's chronic HCV infection status due to the barriers to receive the gold standard viral load testing.

Recently, a novel Xpert HCV Viral Load (VL) Finger-stick (FS) \[Xpert HCV VL FS\] point-of-care (POC) test (Cepheid) has been developed. In an observational cohort in Australia, HCV RNA was detected in 40% of participants (85 of 210) enrolled at 3 drug treatment clinics and 1 homelessness service. Sensitivity of the Xpert HCV VL FS assay for HCV RNA quantification in samples collected by finger-stick was 100.0% (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 93.9%-100.0%) and specificity was 100.0% (95% CI, 96.6%-100.0%). The Xpert HCV VL FS test can accurately detect active infection from a finger-stick sample in 1 hour allowing single-visit HCV diagnosis.

In this protocol, the investigators seek to determine the needs and acceptability of a novel POC HCV viral load testing assay among ED HCV Ab positive patients. For this project, the investigators will identify and enroll ED patients with HCV Ab positive but without HCV viral information. The investigators will conduct a randomized study to assign eligible and consented patients to either to POC Testing Group or Standard of Care (SOC) Group. All participants will take a short survey regarding HCV care and treatment. As part of the investigators' ED HCV Screening and Linkage to Care Program, all participants will receive the standard-of-care clinical laboratory-based HCV RNA viral load testing via whole blood (i.e. patient will receive blood drawn). This standard-of-care HCV viral load testing result will be provided to participant when it is available (usually 1-2 days later). Participants in the POC Testing Group will receive the novel POC HCV RNA viral load testing and the result of the novel test will be disclosed to the patients approximately within 2 hours of the testing. Linkage to care information after the ED visit will be compared between two groups. Finally, accuracy of this POC HCV RNA viral load testing in the acute care setting will be determined as compared to the standard-of-care clinical laboratory-based HCV RNA viral load testing.

"This is a research study to find out if an off-label use of carboxymethylcellulose foam (CMC), an absorbable nasal packing, combined with triamcinolone acetonide, a steroid, is more comfortable postoperatively for participants and is as effective in decreasing scarring, swelling and crusting after surgery than an FDA approved steroid eluting implant. Anticipated sample size will be 30. Study is an intrapatient control design. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive CMC foam with triamcinolone in one nare and the steroid-eluting implant in the other. Participants will fill out preoperative and follow-up visit surveys at 7, 14, 30 and 90 days. Subjects at each visit will also have pictures taken of the nasal cavities to be scored for later analysis. Paired t-tests will be performed for analysis.

Our primary objective is to demonstrate that triamcinolone-impregnated carboxymethylcellulose foam is noninferior to steroid-eluting implants in improving postoperative ethmoid inflammation, middle turbinate position, preventing intranasal synechiae and reducing polypoid change with objective measurement scales Our secondary objects include assessing the quality-of-life and nasal obstruction symptoms before and after functional endoscopic sinus surgery with validated SNOT-22 and NOSE questionnaires and to assess the cost-effectiveness of triamcinolone-impregnated carboxymethylcellulose foam versus steroid-eluting implant in management of CRSwNP in the early postoperative period.

This proposed project aims at examining GABA-mediated inhibition as the potential mechanism behind this link. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance with a reduction of GABAergic inhibition is a common mechanism underlying age-related multisensory and postural deficits potentially mediated by age-related reduction in network segregation. To test this hypothesis, we will assess the relationship between age-related multisensory/postural deficits and age-related reduction in GABA concentration in related brain areas and probe the role of GABA-mediated inhibition using cognitive training that specifically targets inhibitory functions.

"Given the widespread use of anticonvulsants in the pediatric chronic pain population and the absence of scientific data supporting their use, the investigators propose a randomized, double blind, two group parallel design in which a broad group of children and adolescents with chronic neuropathic pain would be randomized to receive either Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine.

The Primary Aim of the Study is to assess the frequencies of successful treatment of pediatric patients with neuropathic pain treated with either Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine.

The Primary Hypotheses are as follows:

Hypothesis I: Both Gabapentin and Oxcarbazepine will result in significant reduction in pain scores when compared to each patient's baseline.

Hypothesis II: Patients who continue on active drug (Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine) during the second phase of the trial will report greater pain reduction relative to baseline than patients who are randomized onto placebo at this randomization point.

Secondary Aims of the Study are to compare groups treated initially with Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine with regard to reduction in pain scores (both at rest and with evoked maneuvers), functional disability scores, tolerability, and measures of mood and cognitive functioning.

Secondary Hypotheses are that Gabapentin and Oxcarbazepine differ in their effects on:

1. Pain scores at rest and with evoked maneuvers
2. Functional disability scores
3. Tolerability (frequencies of side-effects)

"It is universally accepted that high-pressure balloon inflation is required to most effectively deploy a coronary balloon-expandable stent. However, there is not consensus nor are there any guidelines regarding the method of balloon inflation, particularly the duration of inflation. Underexpansion and strut malapposition after stent deployment are among the most powerful predictors for adverse vessel outcomes. High-pressure inflation for stent deployment is effective to optimally expand the stent, but unlike in vitro testing in air, there are poorly distensible plaque elements that may not instantaneously yield to the balloon pressure. However, these elements may ultimately yield to prolonged inflation. Most clinical interventional cardiologists inflate for a relatively short period (15-30 sec). The investigators have noted that when balloon pressure is maintained at a certain pressure level it tends to decrease over time, and may require 60-180 or more seconds to maintain pressure stability. This finding implies that plaque elements are yielding slowly over time to the increased pressure, thus increasing expansion, and suggests that a prolonged inflation until balloon pressure stabilizes is more effective than a rapid inflation/deflation sequence to fully expand and appose the stent to the vessel wall. At present there is no consensus on stent deployment strategy. It is our hypothesis that prolonged inflation is superior to the more commonly used strategy of rapid inflation/deflation.

Optimal coherence tomography (OCT), a novel technology that measures near-infrared light reflections and translates them into a 2D image, has an axial resolution nearly 10-times that of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Thus it is possible to examine the extent of stent apposition and stent expansion using this modality.

The current randomized trial tests the hypothesis that prolonged balloon inflation until a stable balloon pressure is maintained is more effective than a rapid inflation/deflation sequence when performed to the same balloon inflation pressure.",Coronary Artery Disease|Coronary Stent Occlusion,ALL,NA,"John L.
