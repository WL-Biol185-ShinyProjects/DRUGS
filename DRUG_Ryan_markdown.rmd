## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Delete repeating information in table Drug and make new table called UnduplicatedDrug
```{r}
duplicated(Drug)
Drug[ !duplicated(Drug),]

UnduplicatedDrug <- Drug[ !duplicated(Drug),]
View(UnduplicatedDrug
     )

write.csv(UnduplicatedDrug, file = "UnduplicatedDrug.csv")
```
##Deleting duplicated Drug names in UnduplicatedDrug
```{r}
UnduplicatedDrug1 <- UnduplicatedDrug[ !duplicated(UnduplicatedDrug$Drug), ]
View(UnduplicatedDrug1)

write.csv(UnduplicatedDrug1, file = "UnduplicatedDrug1.csv")
```

##Creating a "reviews" column numeric
```{r}
UnduplicatedDrug2 <- data.frame(UnduplicatedDrug1, "Reviews" = sapply(strsplit(UnduplicatedDrug1$Reviews, split = " ", fixed = TRUE), function (x) {x [1]}))

UnduplicatedDrug2$Reviews.1 <- as.numeric(UnduplicatedDrug2$Reviews.1)

write.csv(UnduplicatedDrug2, file = "UnduplicatedDrug2.csv")
```



##bar graph comparing the Drug to the satisfaction rating in regards to condition the drug treats
```{r}
Filtered_UnduplicatedDrug2 <- filter(UnduplicatedDrug2, Condition == 'Acute Bacterial Sinusitis')
  ggplot( Filtered_UnduplicatedDrug2, aes(Drug, Satisfaction)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```
##bar graph comparing the drug to the reviews in regards to the condition the drug treats--might use this later!
#```{r}
Filtered_UnduplicatedDrug1 <- filter(UnduplicatedDrug1, Condition == 'Acute Bacterial Sinusitis')
  ggplot( Filtered_UnduplicatedDrug1, aes(Drug, Reviews)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
##bar graph comparing the drug to how effective it is in regards to the condition the drug treats
  
##bar graph comparign the drug to its ease of use in regards to the condiiton the drug treats
```{r}
Filtered_UnduplicatedDrug2 <- filter(UnduplicatedDrug2, Condition == 'Acute Bacterial Sinusitis')
  ggplot( Filtered_UnduplicatedDrug2, aes(EaseOfUse, Reviews.1)) + geom_point(aes( colour = factor(Drug)))
```

##Satisfaction vs reviews filtered by drugs in a certain condition
```{r}
Filtered_UnduplicatedDrug2 <- filter(UnduplicatedDrug2, Condition == 'Acute Bacterial Sinusitis')
  ggplot( Filtered_UnduplicatedDrug2, aes(Satisfaction, Reviews.1)) + geom_point(aes( colour = factor(Drug)))
```

```{r}
filter(UnduplicatedDrug2, Condition == input$Condition) %>%
      ggplot(aes(EaseOfUse, Reviews.1)) 
       + geom_point(aes( colour = factor(Drug)))
```

```{r}
filter(UnduplicatedDrug2, Condition == input$Condition) %>%
     ggplot(aes(Effective, Reviews.1)) 
      + geom_point(aes
                   (colour = factor
                     (Drug)
                     )
                   )
```
